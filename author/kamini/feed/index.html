										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the manifesto of BJP for Gujarat Elections? Maybe you would remember the promises of Congress party if they win Gujarat? No? Neither do I or majority of people or the media.</p>
<p>Elections are fought by various political parties to demonstrate why they should be in charge of governance of a country or a state. Therefore, one can conclude that all issues about good and better governance would be the larger conversation during electioneering.</p>
<p>But, no! Everything harmful to good governance is actually the campaign plank of parties in India. The conversation and campaigning in Gujarat elections as usual was to embroil the voters into emotional tangles with stuff like, “neech”, “sex videos”, “Mandir”, “masjid” etc.</p>

<p>A concrete example of how low on priority is governance in electioneering can be gauged from the importance given to manifesto by the parties themselves.</p>
<p>The BJP, that is the largest party in power today, released its manifesto a day before the elections. The Cong was slightly better by releasing it 5 days before the elections. BJP’s manifesto has something for the voters to chew on. But Congress party manifesto is like a leaflet drafted by some high school student. The truth is BJP, Congress and our media, all have stopped caring about promises and manifesto. Have a look at the links below to see these two manifestoes.</p>
<p>The voters also don’t seem to miss the most important document for any election. For them too elections is like a heady tamasha.</p>
<p>Neither does the media bring up the subject of party manifesto. Because for them too it’s a lot easier to be part of the tamasha. It requires no research? No need of a good editorial team? So much cheaper and easier to entertain people with political drama of our “Republic”.  The last time someone actually made the effort to track manifesto promises was The Hindu newspaper, which tracked AAP&#8217;s promises after one year. It is perhaps the only media somewhat focusing on this. And worse still, some media resort to lies and fake news for sensationalism or toe the line of their owners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our 70 years old Republic is faced with some shameful and some explosive facts. According to the 2011 Census, only 4.5% of our country’s population is educated to level of graduate. 32.6% is not even educated up to primary level.</p>

<p>41% of India’s population is below the age of 20 years (2011 Census), 50% of the population is in the 20-59 age group. A mind-boggling number of youth will be in need of jobs. But, instead of creation of jobs, demonetization which plunged the country’s GDP to 5.7% saw retrenchments in many areas. ILO in its World Employment &amp; Social Outlook report in Jan, 2017 said unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7million last year to 17.8 million in 2017. This becomes relevant in the face of BJP poll promise of creating 1 crore jobs every year.</p>
<p>The bursting youth population, sinking job opportunities and drumming up of violent, divisive emotional issues of polarization make for an explosive alchemy which may go out of control.</p>
<p>Then there is environment, civic amenities, infrastructure, health, poverty, agriculture crisis which need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Below are links to the Gujarat State manifestoes of BJP and Congress. Judge for yourself which party has done it’s home-work on what it is promising to deliver to the people. Attached is also the APP manifesto for the 2015 Delhi state election because it is the other emerging national level party. What did it promise and what was fulfilled?</p>
<p>Media, informed groups and voters must focus on Party manifestoes and deliverance if elections are to serve the purpose of getting committed people in power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To tax or not to tax are the eternal questions before any government and to-pay-or-not-pay is the eternal difficult choice before the people.</p>
<p>Historically taxation has been the cause of much strain between governments and its citizens. It also is one of the main causes of black money and corruption.</p>
<p>What is the solution? Can low taxes solve this problem? But, how will the Government raise revenue for its expenses?</p>
<p>Let us look at some examples of what happens when Governments lower taxes. We will start very near before we go very far.</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

<p>Delhi’s AAP Government&#8217;s experiment in lowering taxes is a recent example closest to home. They became the lowest tax regime in the country when they slashed VAT ( before GST) from 12.5% to 5% in its 2016 budget on many consumer goods like Sweets, savories, snacks, sanitary napkins, shoes, Ready made garments, e-rickshaws marble, kota, dholpur stone, granite, MDF boards &amp; particle boards, laminates, plywood, blackboard and gave subsidies for battery operated cars. This was a bold decision because 65% of the State&#8217;s revenue comes from VAT.</p>
<p>The logic was that compliance will go up and lower taxes will encourage production and consumption.</p>
<p>Instead of revenues falling, the Govt collected 21% higher revenue as compared to previous year. Which is a lot, if you consider that the previous year they registered a growth of 13% and when VAT was higher.</p>
<p>Delhi also became a state with highest GDP in the country in spite of demonetisation which saw a dip in GDP by 2% in the entire country. Furthermore, if low taxes are clubbed with plugging of leakages in revenue then it is a win-win situation for all. For example, the Delhi Jal Board registered increase in revenue in spite giving 20,000 litres/month free water to those who had metered connections. This gave a spurt to people requesting for metered supply and the estimated enormous Rs. 20,000 crore worth of water leakage was plugged. New pipe lines in 263 colonies were laid ( something that had not been done in last 10 years) and revenue through water went up in spite of the free water.</p>
<p>Now let us move from the near to the far. Dr. Ronald D. Rotunda, distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence, <a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2014/06/23/increasing-revenue-lowering-taxes.">writes in an article</a> defending low taxation, “It is said that tax has two purposes: to raise revenue for the Government and to reduce activity of the people. For eg, alchohol, tobacco etc is taxed high not so much to increase revenue but to discourage activity that is taxed, to change behaviour.”</p>

<p>He argues that lower tax rates can produce more revenue than higher rates just as cheaper Wal-Mart makes more money than Tiffany &amp; Co. When USA lowers the capital gains rate, it collects more than when it raises it, he writes.</p>
<p>So also, high taxes makes people go in for secure investment rather than investing in business which carries risk factors or they simply take their monies to safer heavens resulting in cat-and-mouse chase between people and Governments across the globe as the recent Paradise Paper or earlier more such exposes reveal.</p>
<p>Daniel Mitchell, former McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy writes, “ There is a distinct pattern throughout American history: When tax rates are reduced, the economy’s growth rate improves and living standards increase. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/node/18247/print-display.">Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue</a></p>
<p>Therefore, when there was a successful experiment of the Delhi Govt right under their nose, one wonders why the Prime Minister and Finance minister opted for turning India into the highest paying GST in the world, especially since the nation is reeling under demonetisation and fallen GDP.</p>
<p>Lower lax rates will lift sagging sentiments, spurt investments and maybe prove that Indians are not inherently dishonest, as the Delhi AAP experiment has proved.</p>
