										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi&#8217;s Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) resumed its action after Aam Aadmi Party formed the government for second time on Feb 14, 2015. After arresting 9 people on Feb 16, An anti corruption app was launched on Feb 19, and anti corruption helpline was relaunched in March. First anti corruption helpline was launched by Aam Aadmi Party during its first 49 days rule. Journey of ACB with Delhi govt, LG office and Central govt was not smooth and there has been many issues/contradictions among different offices. While ACB was spreading its wigs and started digging into bigger scams, politics and power started interfering its operations. There was enough media coverage about ACB actions and I was able to sort the ACB related data available on aapdelhidiary blog. Until Jun 2015, ACB performed multiple arrests, registered corruption cases, phone calls on helpline, opened big scams, arrested Delhi Police officials. Here is a brief list of actions (with source) taken by ACB from Feb 2015 to Jun 2015.</p>

<p>While ACB started digging into big scams including 2002 CNG Fitness Scam and arresting Delhi Police officials, On Jun 8, LG office appointed MK Meena as head of Delhi&#8217;s ACB. Later a corruption complaint was lodged with Delhi Govt against Chief MK Meena.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the head of an organization is accused of corruption, then it is difficult to expect any action (anti-corruption) from head, as it might bite back. This is where ACB collapsed and no major actions/arrests were taken post Jun 2015. There have been few complains and FIR are registered by ACB against DWC and some AAP MLAs.</p></blockquote>
