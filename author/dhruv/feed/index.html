										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, Modi won the elections promising wonders for India. Economy would be shining, people would have crores of jobs, Ganga would be clean, criminals and corrupts will be in jail and black money will be back. These were far fetched dreams but every voter at least hoped that there would be some work happening in the right direction, for the progress of our country.</p>
<p>2017 was only the third year of Modi&#8217;s rule and not only do these wonder promises have been burnt to ashes, but they have been publicly mocked and shamed over and over again. And India has taken a big step backward towards regression.</p>

<p>Ganga cleaning barely even started, but the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3800894/How-world-s-dirtiest-river-dirtier-New-study-finds-holy-River-Ganga-contains-POO-pollutants-pesticides-ever.html">Ganga river became dirtier than it ever was</a>. Economy had just started recovering and the Masterstroke of Demonetization crashed it down, causing lakhs of job losses and monetary losses to the country in the magnitude of lakhs of crores of rupees.</p>
<p>The war against corruption was mentioned often in speeches but 2017 was the year when corruption was legalized, at least for political parties. The finance bill passed in March removed the upper limit on political party donation from companies. Foreign funding of parties was legalized, while around the same time, foreign funding of NGOs was blocked. Desperate attempts were made to make the funding more opaque. Who will catch the corrupts, when they&#8217;ll all be hidden under legal protection?</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-2oYWhGCZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>This year&#8217;s Christmas bought even worse news. The overtly publicized 2G Scam, either didn&#8217;t happen or the guilty found their way to escape. Many accusing the judiciary and many more accusing Modi himself for striking a deal with the corrupts for votes. Till now, not a single corrupt politician went to jail under Modi. Corruption whistleblowers and RTI activists also got a huge backstab as respective laws were changed to make life difficult for them.</p>
<p>Law and order took a disastrous turn this year. A wrong number baba turned politician with multiple criminal cases on himself was given the charge for the most populated state in India. Cow related violence broke all records, with 2017 being the deadliest year with over <a href="http://data.indiaspend.com/hate-crime">152 victims </a>across the country. Lynchings, mob violence, riots saw a similar growth in many Modi ruled states. Be it mob violently protesting for another wrong number Baba in Haryana or some government supported people holding movie actors ransom over Padmavati release. These were not isolated incidents, they were a mark of growing intolerance and jobless religious bigots getting offended. Similar violent riots and deaths threats happened over &#8216;Tiger Zinda hai&#8217; and &#8216;Games of Ayodhya&#8217; movies by right wing groups. Muslims were only the beginning, as Christians and Christmas became their next target this year. Modi may not be directly behind all these incidents but he is pretty much Cersei, the Game of Thrones character who funded and appeased to the faith militant for her benefit, which later terribly backfired on her and Kings Landing.</p>

<p>Fake news, propaganda and trolling were the social media highlight of the year. The fake news epidemic reached deadly heights in 2017, when in Jharkhand, several people were lynched based on a Whats app rumor. Later this year, a man was burned alive for revenge of Love Jihad, another phenomena which is more prevalent in what&#8217;s app messages than in real life. BJP IT Cell and right wing pages have been the torchbearers of fake news here, constantly promoting cold blooded murder videos from Mexico and Brazil as Muslims killing Hindus in India. Online trolling and abusing also crossed all limits of craziness when the world came to know that the Indian Prime minister follows many of such trolls and abusers on twitter. The same trolls which mocked the murder of a top journalist, Gauri Lankesh this year. Talking of trolls, India got its very own North Korean TV Channel in the form of Republic TV. Openly funded by a BJP MP, the channel danced on tunes of Modi government to help spread its propaganda, many a times shamelessly using fake news.</p>
<p>Modi personally, maintained his record for being the least accountable PM, never attending a single press conference but giving over 775 one way speeches (not including all the man ki baats) and 2 scripted interviews.</p>
<p>It would be hard for anyone to continue ruling India with this extent of failures, backstabs and U-turns. It would be disaster for Modi the day the people come to know about his ultimate efforts to protect the corrupts and criminals. The only way he can survive would be by placing more faith on the faith militant to brainwash the poor jobless people, fill up their hungry stomachs with communal hatred, who would then vote for their messiah to fight the imaginary anti-nationals. I predict 2018 will see more funding been diverted to propaganda channels, expect more fake news, more statues, more renaming and more appeasement of septons and the faith militant. Expect corruption and criminals to magically disappear in 2018, because Modi has already legalized corruption and promoted the criminals to highest of posts. And of course, expect cleaner and developed India in newspapers and your mobile screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the night of 8th November, all 500, 1000 notes were demonetised. This Demonetization shook the nation overnight. Our Prime Minister said all black money kept in cash would become useless, black money hoarders would now have to burn away their stashes or throw them in the river. Like any other common Indian, I thought this might be a great idea and congratulated Modi for it. But it took just a day of research to realise how many loopholes had been left in this scheme. on 12th November, I made this video exposing the intentional loopholes left in the scheme for corrupt people to get away with.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpQBghg_neY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

</script></p>
<p>Over time it became clear how these loopholes are going to be utilised by every single person having black money. Some started black marketing of buying demonetized currency while others used these loopholes to deposit other&#8217;s people&#8217;s black money in banks. This was proved later this year how almost all demonitized currency had returned to the banks, specifically 99%. What also became clear over time was the negative consequences, disastrous negative consequences this scheme would be having on India&#8217;s economy. Many well known economists and politicians pointed this out. Manmohan Singh and Arvind Kejriwal were among the first ones to speak against this. MMS predicted a fall of 2% of India&#8217;s GDP and called it <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-is-an-organised-loot-Manmohan-Singh/article16693025.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organised loot</a>. AK called it India&#8217;s biggest scam ever as he believed it was meant to write off lakhs of crores of loans of billionares. They both were criticised like hell for it initially, but as time passed by, people realised how true they were. On the other hand, the BJP and PM Modi kept chest thumping on their apparent fight against Corruption through demonetization. They even went on exaggerating it&#8217;s potential benefits, from stopping terrorist attacks to becoming cashless. It was around a couple of months that DeMo became a joke that it was a solution to all problems. Anyone opposing it was labelled as anti national and reminded about Siachen ke jawan. That&#8217;s when i had released a video faking about how Demonetization stopped global warming.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gtzg10ge4Po?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>Over the months, all potential positive benefits turned out to be sham. Neither the corruption reduced, nor the fake currency stopped printing. Cashless usage reduced to pre-demonetization era after February 2017. As for the Black money, RBI stopped giving out details fearing public backlash for months. Indian army faced one of the worst terrorst attacks in the same month as demonetisation, and later one of the worst month for casualties in April 2017. GDP loss began to reflect in the numbers, job losses happened in millions, businesses were closed down, more than 150 people even died during this whole event. All through, govts goalposts kept shifting. It was in August this year that they finally revealed the data and Demonetisation was proved to be a disaster.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrPLI029Jic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I participated in a TV debate on Mirror Now news channel on this topic and then exposed all their nonsense excuses to make Demonetization look like a success later in this video.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QiurIHoSbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Estimates of total loss of money to the country range from 4 Lakh Crore to 8 Lakh Crore. Regardless of the actual figure, its no doubt that Demonetization is much bigger than any existing scam done in India till now. Ironically enough, the BJP has said that they will do another one of their &#8216;grand celebration&#8217; on the one year anniversary of Demonetization, which they have called as &#8216;anti-black money&#8217; day. The day black money was converted to white.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This title is no exaggeration. Forget multiple crackers , Just one firecracker, one phooljhadi generates as much smoke as 74 cigarettes if you stand within one feet from it. This has been concluded by a 2016  <a href="http://www.ers-education.org/home/browse-all-content.aspx?idParent=155716">study</a> by Chest Research Foundation in Pune. It analyzed six different crackers– the snake , a 1000 cracker ladi,  phuljhadi,  pul-pul , anar  and chakri for their PM 2.5 pollution levels. These pollution levels were then compared to average PM 2.5 generated by a cigarette by <a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/smoke-from-firecracker-snake-464-cigarettes-and-other-diwali-stories-53583">India Spend</a>. It then gave the following estimations of smoke generated by firecrackers compared to cigarettes &#8211;</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

</script></p>
<p>1. One Chakri generates as much smoke as 68 cigarettes</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-417 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers.jpeg" alt="crackers" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers.jpeg 400w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></p>
<p>2. This seemingly harmless cracker is one of the most dangerous ones. One Snake cracker generates as much smoke as 464 cigarettes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-418 " src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks.jpg" alt="crackers" width="590" height="311" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks.jpg 759w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>3. One anar cracker generates as much smoke as 34 cigarettes. This is comparatively lower than other crackers because one stands around 3 feet away from anar when it is bursting instead of the usual one feet.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-419 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar.jpg" alt="crackers" width="725" height="408" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar.jpg 1920w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. One ladi cracker of 1000 generates as much smoke as 277 cigarettes. Even when standing further away, a ladi is one of the most polluting crackers.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-420 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="crackers" width="715" height="402" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault.jpg 1920w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S0 assuming on average if a cracker emits smoke as much as 100 cigarettes and you burst just 20 crackers this Diwali then you will end up inhaling as much smoke as 2000 cigarettes. With regards to pollution levels, <span style="background-color: #f6d5d9;">India </span>has a 24-hour mean standard of 60 µg/m³ for PM 2.5 pollution, while the WHO has a lower standard of 25 µg/m³. When bursting crackers, this pollution level is broken massively, where a single cracker during it&#8217;s duration of bursting is generating upto 60,000  µg/m³ of PM 2.5 pollution. Now whether you agree with <a href="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/firecrackers-ban-good-bad/">Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to ban firecrackers</a> or not, that is a talk for some other time..</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re someone who thinks that bursting crackers is not a big source of pollution and like to blame it on other things, then think again! In no other event across the year, are your lungs this vulnerable to pollution. Overall air pollution may be caused by a variety of things from burning fields to cars or industries. But none of these other factors are ever affecting you directly by being in close proximity to you. This one day of Diwali will have an unprecedented toll on your health, should you choose to burst crackers. Fortunately enough, your health is in your own control. These distastrous health effects are only caused when you are in close proximity to crackers, that means you are bursting them yourself. So, do your lungs a favour this diwali, by staying away from crackers and advise the same to your family and friends. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In this video, I talk about why the petrol price have risen this record high.

Important thing to note here is the change in crude oil prices which has happened in the past few years. In 2012/2013, it had risen very high to $109 per barrel but came down in the last three years since then. Another important chart here is the the breakdown of the petrol tax which you are paying nowadays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world of fake news and propaganda, real information takes a backseat. Thankfully, more youngsters are coming out and voicing their opinions taking advantage of the visibility social media platforms provide. While fiercely opinionated partisan videos continue to dominate the cyberspace, Dhruv Rathee uses the platform to disseminate information on issues mainstream journalists generally refrain from taking on.</p>
<p>Mostly known for his political explosive videos with an essence of satire, Rathee has over 50,000 subscribers on his channel, which he started in 2015. Be it the controversial cow politics or AAP-BJP war, his videos are popular because of the latent dark humour he incorporates.</p>
