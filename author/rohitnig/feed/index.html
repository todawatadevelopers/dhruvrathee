										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is said that talking to Bhakts is like talking to a wall, all arguments and responses that BJP supporters aka Bhakts use can summaryied into 4 standard sets for any shortcomings that get highlighted in the Modi government&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>1. The most common one is that the &#8220;Country has been left in such a huge mess by the utter mismanagement and corruption and misadministration of the Congress governments in the last 67 (yes 67, nothing less than that) years that it will take at least a decade to fix issues&#8221;. Of course they just discount that the average GDP growth since 1990-2014 with the old formula was better than the average GDP growth of 2014-2017. And yeah, IITs, NITs, BARC, ISRO, etc. all dropped from a planet of the Alpha Centauri solar system.</p>

<p>2. The second response is that Indians are to be blamed for it. The Swacch Bharat movement started by Modi was one of the most brilliant steps that he ever took. Not only did he hand the accountability back to the citizens, he also raised about Rs 1000 Crore every financial year for cleaning the country. But there were no measures taken to make the municipalities or the state governments more accountable. Of course, he is not accountable for anything that&#8217;s wrong in India, as per these Bhakts and BJP supporters.</p>

<p>3. The third response is to just pooh-pooh the claims. You see, things are not as bad as the &#8216;Presstitutes&#8217; are claiming it to be! Demonetization killed no one. There are no job losses. The industries are working super fine. Kashmiris are now loving Indians more. Nepal is not moving towards China. India is not the most corrupt nation in Asia. Saas Bahu serials are the UNESCO certified best in the world. Anti-national JNU students are to be blamed for all the problems in the country. And so on.</p>
<p>4. The final one is, the news is actually a good thing! CBI not being given more autonomy is actually a good thing as it would be against democratic structures of India. India not having a Lokpal is actually a good thing because PM should be supreme. Corruption being legalized due to <a href="https://youtu.be/J-2oYWhGCZg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finance Bill is good for the country</a>i. Whistle Blower laws being diluted is actually a good thing because they interfere in the governance. Destruction of RTI is actually a good thing because it slows down bureaucracy!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we say, You can awaken a sleeping person, but not someone who is pretending to be asleep&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The problem in Mumbai is not about immigration. It is about the poor people from other sick states. The poor people who live in dirty filthy slums and destroy the beauty of the Maximum city.</p>
<p>Take Dubai for example. It is so clean, you don&#8217;t see any poor anywhere, in fact most people understand there is no poverty in Dubai at all.</p>
<p>Mumbai is the financial capital of the country, or was, till Delhi/NCR took over last year, but still it pays the most tax in the country. Well, let&#8217;s forget that the headquarter of most companies which do business all over the country are situated in Mumbai so the taxes by these companies have the Mumbai address.</p>
<p>So, if Mumbai is so rich, and pays so much of tax and the whole damn country is relying on this maximum city, why can&#8217;t it be as squeaky clean and disciplined as Dubai?</p>
<p>Dubai has dealt well with the poverty. It calls the poor immigrants from other countries, ensures they don&#8217;t get their passports back, dumps this cheap or free labour in concentration camps, sucks out the blood and sweat, and ensures that the world doesn&#8217;t see them.</p>
<p>Mumbai needs to emulate. See, Mumbai is surviving on cheap labour imported by the BIMARU (Sick) states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. If there was no cheap labour, the profit margins will be affected and profit is everything for the businesses which run out of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Everyone knows when the cheap labour came that, if decent living was given to them then the labour would not be cheap anymore. So, the city has thrown 54% of its population in the slums. In these slums, the men labour out, the women end up in Chandni Bars, the children go to filthy MCD schools. MCD &#8211; A state with a budget of Rs 36K Crore! These poor filthy immigrants from other BIMARU states don&#8217;t deserve better schools and hospitals so the administrators, which mostly are not immigrants but locals, pocket in all these money and then file a defamation case on whomsoever puts the blame on them.</p>
<p>The poorly educated poor immigrants never really get out of the wheel of poverty and remain undisciplined. As Mumbai is not as disciplined as Dubai, these people keep on ruining the lovely city of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Mumbai would be better than Dubai if all these immigrants from the sick states leave. It doesn&#8217;t matter that the 70% of immigrants are not from these sick states but from Maharashtra itself. A state which is reeling since decades in water shortage, where the politicians have been looting in the name of irrigation. If the irrigation scam gets stopped the Maharashtrian farmer can live a comfortable life in his own village, reducing the load on Mumbai, but let&#8217;s not look into it right now.</p>
<p>If all immigrants from the sick states leave, Mumbai will be better than Dubai &#8211; It would be Detroit! Detroit &#8211; A once booming city which has kind of died right now, but at least it has got rid of all the immigrants!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-374" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-374" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey.jpg" alt="Mumbai" width="318" height="424" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey.jpg 1072w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey-769x1024.jpg 769w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-374" class="wp-caption-text">Detroit&#8217;s decline captured in google street view</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the capital of the biggest sick state &#8211; Lucknow, now has a functioning Metro of 8.5 KM whereas the maximum city has a functioning metro of 11.40 KM. I am amazed at the kind of focus Maharashtra has put in order to improve the public transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s keep the immigrants in Mumbai for just a bit more, till the 3600 Crore Statue of the Great Shivaji gets constructed (as his forts rot away) and then Mumbai can have an immigration policy where work visas are given to people from BIMARU states.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-362" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-362 size-full" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali-pollution-759-1.jpg" alt="firecracker" width="759" height="422" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali-pollution-759-1.jpg 759w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali-pollution-759-1-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-362" class="wp-caption-text">Firecrackers and pollution</figcaption></figure>
<p class="qtext_para">A good friend of mine in Delhi was very tense. Her son had developed severe symptoms of asthma at a young age and she was feeling helpless. Although I never mentioned to her, she said that she would understand if I chose to settle in Canada.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">A friend of mine was furious. He saw smog engulf his room. His kid was choking and there was little that he could do. When this judgement was released, not only did he welcome it, he also openly abused on Facebook anyone who was critical to it.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">The pollution levels of Delhi are <b>insane</b>. If WHO says 50 PPM is safe, the city would be at 600+! An American diplomat literally ran for his life, away from Delhi, back to USA.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">I saw a Diwali video my parents sent me via WhatsApp. I have lived in about 9 cities in India, but the amount of crackers Delhiites burn (or blast) is insane. My parents live on 10th floor, the ideal height for the sky bursters to burst, and they kept on bursting right in front of their balcony!</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">All said and done, I feel this judgement really won’t achieve anything apart from infuriating the religious zealots and giving fake assurance to the ecology lovers. Here is why:</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><b>WHAT POLLUTES DELHI’S AIR</b></p>
<ol>
<li>ROAD DUST: 50% [Solution : <b>Grass the footpaths </b>]</li>
<li>INDUSTRIES: 23% [Solution : <b>Regulate the Industries </b>]</li>
<li>LOCAL DUST GENERATION: 20% [Solution : <b>Plant more trees </b>]</li>
<li>VEHICULAR: 7% [Solution :<b> Improve Public Transport </b>]</li>
</ol>
<p class="qtext_para">The Delhi’s air is literally screwed all around the year. During the Autumn, crops are burnt in the farms and the crop ash ends up falling inside Delhi. This makes Delhi a gas chamber ~ <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-pollution-nightmare-crop-burning-in-nearby-states-begins/story-djXJY8W0Ugzm8dgsxmbN0K.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brace for air pollution in Delhi as crop burning starts in neighbouring states</a></span></p>
<p>Regardless, I feel that every Indian and especially people living in NCR and Delhi should support the current ban by Supreme court. It may not clean Delhi&#8217;s gas chamber like air but it will certainly stop it from making it even worse like last year when Delhi broke record for registering a pollution level of 999, which was the maximum any PM 2.5 measuring scale could measure.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">What I observed during Diwali in Chennai was that although the crackers were more expensive, they were not generating a lot of smoke. In Mississauga, Canada, the government had non stop fireworks for 15 minutes right in front of where I live and hardly any smoke was generated. More firework was burnt than a colony burns in 2 hours in some Indian city.</p>
<p>Better quality but expensive crackers will go a long way in decreasing pollution during Diwali</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Outright banning firecrackers in Diwali might be an experiment, but it’s not a solution. It would lead to black marketing of firecrackers, more corruption, contempt of court and bad blood among the Indians.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">A more pragmatic approach would have been to pick the highest to lowest polluters (mentioned above) one at a time.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">And definitely not increasing the Metro Fares!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arnab Goswami is self-proclaimed most &#8216;nationalist&#8217; journalist ever born in India. His TV news channel is also a self-proclaimed independent &#8220;only&#8221; independent new venture. The reality is far from that, here are 7 reasons why every truly nationalist Indian should boycott him and his Republic TV</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>He tries to create outrages over every issue that he likes. This will mean conveniently ignoring any topic which is against the people funding him. Every time a controversy happens against the ruling party, he would need to switch to other issues to bury that topic. What ends up happening is that stuff like Hrithik &#8211; Kangana gets more importance than Amit Shah&#8217;s controversy.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FHoezaay%2Fvideos%2F1540087629412195%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</li>
<li>Arnab Goswami misses many, rather most real issues which actually affect our everyday lives. Forget about any controversy of ruling party for a second. The problem for common Indians is that he also ignores most topics of general importance like petrol price rise, demonetisation, GDP falling, economy falling, Aadhar privacy etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7410747505660370" data-ad-slot="3826376908"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<ol>
<li>People shout when others refuse to hear them. Shouting must be the last resort, not the first one, as is the case in his panel debates.</li>
<li>Arnab has the volume control of every panelist. He uses that to ensure which panelist can be heard easily by the viewer and which panelist cannot be heard, no matter how much he shouts.</li>
<li>Because of the &#8220;Shout As Loud as You Can&#8221; format of the show, logic takes a back seat, objectivity takes a back seat, even the beauty of the language takes a back seat. A lot can be said using few beautiful words. I have seen Ravish doing that. His soft words hit hard!</li>
<li>His open bias makes it intolerable to consider his news channel serious journalism. What can be a bigger irony, calling themselves the most independent news venture but still being funded by a present member of parliament. This video by Dhruv rathee does a good job of exposing his bias.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//pQdJq_ohLXQ" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</li>
<li>He tries to make you tense, and once you are over it, and his words stop affecting you, all you hear is noise from a fish market. You find Discovery Channel heavenly!</li>

<p>There are more sane, civil ways to indulge in a discussion and debate. And when Ravish started his debates in NDTV Hindi, that was the end of Arnab&#8217;s TV Colloseum for critical thinkers and news watchers like me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the very long history of Human civilization, many languages have survived, many have thrived, many have died a slow death. Few think that Hindi is pushing other languages to oblivion. But how true is that?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, languages like Sanskrit, Latin and even Persian were thriving. Today, they are confined to a much smaller dominion.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Hindi_devnagari.png" alt="Hindi" /><br />
Is Hindi causing the death of other languages? First of all, are we really speaking Hindi in our daily lives?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t speak Hindi any more. We speak Hindustani. It&#8217;s a language which is a mixture of Hindi, Urdu and Persian. Whenever you speak pure Hindi, you receive a look of amusement even from the so called Hindi speakers.</p>
<p>Now, is Hindustani destroying other languages? Hindustani has thrived mainly due to two aspects &#8211; Simplicity and Acceptance. It has slowly given up complicated words from both Urdu and Sanskrit and has adopted easier words. This is also the main reason why English is most popular in the world.</p>
<p>Any simple language will spread on its own. This is the law of nature and nothing can supersede it. It can be slowed down, but never stopped. You cannot get back Latin and kick away English. English was once a language of poor and commoner and was associated with poverty and still it spread because it kept on adopting words from different languages. This acceptance is also the primary reason why English is a phonetically incorrect language.</p>
<p>Due to a multiple reasons, English has been unable to penetrate the rural India, specially in North India. Hence it would be foolish to expect that English can take place of Hindustani in India within a span of a few more decades.</p>
<p>Hindustani is spreading and will keep on spreading as it keeps on accepting words from different languages. Any language which is not open to accepting vocabulary of other languages will die away with time.</p>
<p>Language is essentially the medium of communication and Humans tend to bend towards ease and simplicity.</p>
<p>No matter how much Indian government pushes India towards pure Hindi, it would fail. With time, even the pure Hindi might die.</p>
