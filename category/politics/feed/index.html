										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the manifesto of BJP for Gujarat Elections? Maybe you would remember the promises of Congress party if they win Gujarat? No? Neither do I or majority of people or the media.</p>
<p>Elections are fought by various political parties to demonstrate why they should be in charge of governance of a country or a state. Therefore, one can conclude that all issues about good and better governance would be the larger conversation during electioneering.</p>
<p>But, no! Everything harmful to good governance is actually the campaign plank of parties in India. The conversation and campaigning in Gujarat elections as usual was to embroil the voters into emotional tangles with stuff like, “neech”, “sex videos”, “Mandir”, “masjid” etc.</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

</script></p>
<p>A concrete example of how low on priority is governance in electioneering can be gauged from the importance given to manifesto by the parties themselves.</p>
<p>The BJP, that is the largest party in power today, released its manifesto a day before the elections. The Cong was slightly better by releasing it 5 days before the elections. BJP’s manifesto has something for the voters to chew on. But Congress party manifesto is like a leaflet drafted by some high school student. The truth is BJP, Congress and our media, all have stopped caring about promises and manifesto. Have a look at the links below to see these two manifestoes.</p>
<p>The voters also don’t seem to miss the most important document for any election. For them too elections is like a heady tamasha.</p>
<p>Neither does the media bring up the subject of party manifesto. Because for them too it’s a lot easier to be part of the tamasha. It requires no research? No need of a good editorial team? So much cheaper and easier to entertain people with political drama of our “Republic”.  The last time someone actually made the effort to track manifesto promises was The Hindu newspaper, which tracked AAP&#8217;s promises after one year. It is perhaps the only media somewhat focusing on this. And worse still, some media resort to lies and fake news for sensationalism or toe the line of their owners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our 70 years old Republic is faced with some shameful and some explosive facts. According to the 2011 Census, only 4.5% of our country’s population is educated to level of graduate. 32.6% is not even educated up to primary level.</p>

<p>41% of India’s population is below the age of 20 years (2011 Census), 50% of the population is in the 20-59 age group. A mind-boggling number of youth will be in need of jobs. But, instead of creation of jobs, demonetization which plunged the country’s GDP to 5.7% saw retrenchments in many areas. ILO in its World Employment &amp; Social Outlook report in Jan, 2017 said unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7million last year to 17.8 million in 2017. This becomes relevant in the face of BJP poll promise of creating 1 crore jobs every year.</p>
<p>The bursting youth population, sinking job opportunities and drumming up of violent, divisive emotional issues of polarization make for an explosive alchemy which may go out of control.</p>
<p>Then there is environment, civic amenities, infrastructure, health, poverty, agriculture crisis which need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Below are links to the Gujarat State manifestoes of BJP and Congress. Judge for yourself which party has done it’s home-work on what it is promising to deliver to the people. Attached is also the APP manifesto for the 2015 Delhi state election because it is the other emerging national level party. What did it promise and what was fulfilled?</p>
<p>Media, informed groups and voters must focus on Party manifestoes and deliverance if elections are to serve the purpose of getting committed people in power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, Modi won the elections promising wonders for India. Economy would be shining, people would have crores of jobs, Ganga would be clean, criminals and corrupts will be in jail and black money will be back. These were far fetched dreams but every voter at least hoped that there would be some work happening in the right direction, for the progress of our country.</p>
<p>2017 was only the third year of Modi&#8217;s rule and not only do these wonder promises have been burnt to ashes, but they have been publicly mocked and shamed over and over again. And India has taken a big step backward towards regression.</p>

<p>Ganga cleaning barely even started, but the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3800894/How-world-s-dirtiest-river-dirtier-New-study-finds-holy-River-Ganga-contains-POO-pollutants-pesticides-ever.html">Ganga river became dirtier than it ever was</a>. Economy had just started recovering and the Masterstroke of Demonetization crashed it down, causing lakhs of job losses and monetary losses to the country in the magnitude of lakhs of crores of rupees.</p>
<p>The war against corruption was mentioned often in speeches but 2017 was the year when corruption was legalized, at least for political parties. The finance bill passed in March removed the upper limit on political party donation from companies. Foreign funding of parties was legalized, while around the same time, foreign funding of NGOs was blocked. Desperate attempts were made to make the funding more opaque. Who will catch the corrupts, when they&#8217;ll all be hidden under legal protection?</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s Christmas bought even worse news. The overtly publicized 2G Scam, either didn&#8217;t happen or the guilty found their way to escape. Many accusing the judiciary and many more accusing Modi himself for striking a deal with the corrupts for votes. Till now, not a single corrupt politician went to jail under Modi. Corruption whistleblowers and RTI activists also got a huge backstab as respective laws were changed to make life difficult for them.</p>
<p>Law and order took a disastrous turn this year. A wrong number baba turned politician with multiple criminal cases on himself was given the charge for the most populated state in India. Cow related violence broke all records, with 2017 being the deadliest year with over <a href="http://data.indiaspend.com/hate-crime">152 victims </a>across the country. Lynchings, mob violence, riots saw a similar growth in many Modi ruled states. Be it mob violently protesting for another wrong number Baba in Haryana or some government supported people holding movie actors ransom over Padmavati release. These were not isolated incidents, they were a mark of growing intolerance and jobless religious bigots getting offended. Similar violent riots and deaths threats happened over &#8216;Tiger Zinda hai&#8217; and &#8216;Games of Ayodhya&#8217; movies by right wing groups. Muslims were only the beginning, as Christians and Christmas became their next target this year. Modi may not be directly behind all these incidents but he is pretty much Cersei, the Game of Thrones character who funded and appeased to the faith militant for her benefit, which later terribly backfired on her and Kings Landing.</p>

<p>Fake news, propaganda and trolling were the social media highlight of the year. The fake news epidemic reached deadly heights in 2017, when in Jharkhand, several people were lynched based on a Whats app rumor. Later this year, a man was burned alive for revenge of Love Jihad, another phenomena which is more prevalent in what&#8217;s app messages than in real life. BJP IT Cell and right wing pages have been the torchbearers of fake news here, constantly promoting cold blooded murder videos from Mexico and Brazil as Muslims killing Hindus in India. Online trolling and abusing also crossed all limits of craziness when the world came to know that the Indian Prime minister follows many of such trolls and abusers on twitter. The same trolls which mocked the murder of a top journalist, Gauri Lankesh this year. Talking of trolls, India got its very own North Korean TV Channel in the form of Republic TV. Openly funded by a BJP MP, the channel danced on tunes of Modi government to help spread its propaganda, many a times shamelessly using fake news.</p>
<p>Modi personally, maintained his record for being the least accountable PM, never attending a single press conference but giving over 775 one way speeches (not including all the man ki baats) and 2 scripted interviews.</p>
<p>It would be hard for anyone to continue ruling India with this extent of failures, backstabs and U-turns. It would be disaster for Modi the day the people come to know about his ultimate efforts to protect the corrupts and criminals. The only way he can survive would be by placing more faith on the faith militant to brainwash the poor jobless people, fill up their hungry stomachs with communal hatred, who would then vote for their messiah to fight the imaginary anti-nationals. I predict 2018 will see more funding been diverted to propaganda channels, expect more fake news, more statues, more renaming and more appeasement of septons and the faith militant. Expect corruption and criminals to magically disappear in 2018, because Modi has already legalized corruption and promoted the criminals to highest of posts. And of course, expect cleaner and developed India in newspapers and your mobile screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi&#8217;s Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) resumed its action after Aam Aadmi Party formed the government for second time on Feb 14, 2015. After arresting 9 people on Feb 16, An anti corruption app was launched on Feb 19, and anti corruption helpline was relaunched in March. First anti corruption helpline was launched by Aam Aadmi Party during its first 49 days rule. Journey of ACB with Delhi govt, LG office and Central govt was not smooth and there has been many issues/contradictions among different offices. While ACB was spreading its wigs and started digging into bigger scams, politics and power started interfering its operations. There was enough media coverage about ACB actions and I was able to sort the ACB related data available on aapdelhidiary blog. Until Jun 2015, ACB performed multiple arrests, registered corruption cases, phone calls on helpline, opened big scams, arrested Delhi Police officials. Here is a brief list of actions (with source) taken by ACB from Feb 2015 to Jun 2015.</p>

<p>While ACB started digging into big scams including 2002 CNG Fitness Scam and arresting Delhi Police officials, On Jun 8, LG office appointed MK Meena as head of Delhi&#8217;s ACB. Later a corruption complaint was lodged with Delhi Govt against Chief MK Meena.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the head of an organization is accused of corruption, then it is difficult to expect any action (anti-corruption) from head, as it might bite back. This is where ACB collapsed and no major actions/arrests were taken post Jun 2015. There have been few complains and FIR are registered by ACB against DWC and some AAP MLAs.</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar collects the demographic as well as biometric data of whoever who has it.  Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act ensures that under the guise of “<em>national security</em>”, the government can access any information <strong>without</strong> providing any explanation to anyone. It does not define what is “national security” so <strong>any reason</strong> can be used to access and use this data. So in short, one can say that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar is a surveillance technology masquerading as secure authentication technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">See the annotation (1) for further reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>B) But at least it is not affecting anyone directly. Then why we should worry?</strong></b></p>
<p>The threat is not only of mass surveillance but there are also some serious drawbacks.  By making Aadhar compulsory, people in rural areas and underprivileged people are facing numerous problems.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.Aadhaar is compulsory for two more groups of citizens – victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, and workers rescued from bonded labor. The court took 15 years to decide who is eligible or not, whether the person is who they are claiming to be and Now, the government wants the victims to prove their identity in this manner again. Same problem with bonded workers. (2)</p>
<p>2.Thousands of pensioners without Aadhaar or bank accounts struck off lists in Rajasthan (3)</p>
<p>3.Jharkhand: Family denied ration over Aadhaar linking, girl starves to death (4)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>C) Where we do have to link it and what can be its effects?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.You have to link it to your SIM card, pan card, passport, bank account, voter ID, college/university. And if you want benefits of schemes like LPG, MGNREGS, etc. you have to link Aadhar to them also.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2.According to Aadhar act 2016,  “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or any other appropriate response sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric information.”</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">3.Which also means authority with whom you are linking Aadhar can have access to your photograph (which doesn’t come under core-biometrics) and your demographic information which includes as name, date of birth, address and &#8220;other relevant information&#8221; of an individual. It explicitly excludes race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history.</p>
<p>4.Well, this is legal (but a worrying) way to give our personal details to authority. But there are other ways also.. Like:-  Aadhaar data of 130 million, bank account details leaked from govt websites: Report  (5)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">5.To be fair, two safeguards are in place in the Aadhaar Act. One is that the requesting entity must inform you about the use it proposes to make of your identity information.( But who reads the fine print of the terms and conditions when buying a sim card, or before clicking “I agree” when installing new software?) The second safeguard is that the requesting entity cannot publish or display your Aadhaar number (or your core biometric information, but that is not accessible to a requesting entity in the first place).</p>
<p>6.Note, however, that nothing prevents a requesting entity from publishing or displaying other identity information, as long as it has informed the concerned person.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But wait&#8230;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">7.The Clause 33 (2) states that an official with the rank of <b><strong>Joint Secretary or higher</strong></b> may access a person&#8217;s identity information including core biometric information if the official has an order issued in the interest of national security by the central government.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The government has the power to know and use your fingerprints, iris scan for the <em>“National Security”</em>. The recent trend of classifying people as &#8220;Anti Nationals&#8221; by the government-sponsored trolls makes this a huge concern for everyone. So there&#8217;s actually a very high possibility of the happening that you criticize the government, the government framed you as an anti-national and steals your biometric data to use it against you.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-628 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Big_Brother_eye_logo_for_the_16th_UK_series.jpg" alt="aadhar" width="423" height="235" /></p>
<p><b><strong>D) If there are such serious loopholes, why does the Government want to make it mandatory?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Supreme Court, way back in October 2015, clarified that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for any schemes/services other than ration (PDS), employment guarantee (MNREGS), LPG distribution, pension, provident funds (EPF) and Jan Dhan Yojana. (see the highlighted part &#8211; (6) )</p>
<p>2.So today, whatever gov is making mandatory to link this and that with Aadhar is <strong>actually illegal</strong>. And supreme court reminds this to center in last month.  (7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><strong>E) So, is it necessary to link Aadhar with gov schemes?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.As per <em>“Government of India rule”</em>, yes it is <strong>mandatory</strong> to link it to six welfare schemes, PAN cards, and mobile phones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2.Other than these, ALL other schemes/services/benefits for which Aadhaar is being made mandatory go directly against the earlier Supreme Court order. Including the bank account linking.</p>
<p>3.BUT the government continues its assault unabated. Even the regulations they cleared under the act were quite illegal and had many many loopholes. This is where the confusion begins.</p>
<p><b><strong>F)  Does Aadhar violate the fundamental right to privacy or not?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it does!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>G) Then how did the Aadhaar Act pass in Parliament? (read H) &amp; I) also)</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was passed with shrewdness.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">First, it was introduced in the Budget session of 2016 as a <strong>money bill</strong>. But Aadhar is not a money bill in any sense.</p>
<p><b><strong>H) What are money bills then?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.Bills which exclusively contain provisions for imposition and abolition of taxes, for the appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund, etc., are certified as Money Bills.</p>
<p>2.And Aadhar has nothing to do with these things. Only the <strong>speaker</strong> has the right to called a bill a money bill, but in case of Aadhar, <em>Mr. Arun Jaitley</em> himself introduce it as the money bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>I) Why was it introduced as Money Bill?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Lok Sabha has majority members of ruling party but not in Rajya Sabha. Mr. Jaitley was aware that if this bill introduced the normal bill it will be debated in Rajya Sabha.</p>
<p>2.So after introducing it as a Money Bill, it will no longer under the control of members of Rajya Sabha. Rajya Sabha members can suggest amendments but Lok Sabha has every right to accept or reject those amendments. Guess what happens in Aadhar bill?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lok Sabha <em>rejected</em> the amendments made by Rajya Sabha members and passed the bill. (8)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But the most dangerous thing is –</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>J) How is Government trying to set bureaucracy (and not democracy) regarding Aadhar Act?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For that, we take a wonderful journey all the way to <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/administrator/uploads/media/AADHAAR/Aadhaar%20Bill,%202016.pdf">Clause 58 on Page 17.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">(1) If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, by order, published in the Official Gazette, make such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this Acts may appear to be necessary for removing the difficulty: Provided that no such order shall be made under this section after the expiry of three years from the commencement of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This clause basically puts in a &#8216;lockdown&#8217; provision. Before that comes into effect, they <strong><em>can make changes</em></strong> in the bill by notification in the Gazette ( a written record of bills which passed as an Act). Basically, bureaucrats will have a free reign over what this bill will do after it is passed by Parliament.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And this is very serious.</p>

<p><b><strong>K) What is the role of ministers in this?</strong></b></p>
<p><strong>Arun Jaitley</strong> admits that he is forcing people to create Aadhar card and to link with Gov schemes (even though it does not follow Supreme Court’s order). –</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD) said the Supreme Court had said in September last year that Aadhaar is not mandatory and wanted to know whether the government was “<strong>forcing</strong>” people to get it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“<b><strong>Yes, we are</strong></b>,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jaitley replied.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/yqmxejgaeg-1490259699.jpeg" width="609" height="274" /></p>
<p>Mr. Narendra Modi as a<strong> CM of Gujrat</strong> thoughts that Aadhar there is no vision in this scheme-</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Aadhaar, neither the Team that I met nor PM could answer my Qs on security threat it can pose. There is no vision, only political gimmick</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 8, 2014</p>
<p><b><strong>L) So who is really responsible for this? UPA or NDA government?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Aadhar card or  National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 (NIDAI)  was introduced by the then PM Dr. Manmohan Singh along with Nandan Nilekani as an optional card that wasn’t meant to be mandatory for all citizens. What started out as a simple identity card that would be provided to all Indians.</p>
<p>2.The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016 is a money bill of the Parliament of India. It aims to provide legal backing to the Aadhaar unique identification number project by making it mandatory for people who want benefits subsidies or schemes.</p>
<p>3.The foundational shift that occurred between the National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 (NIDAI) and the Aadhaar Act 2016 is clear from their respective definitions of authentication:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NIDAI 2010</strong>: “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive or negative response or with any other appropriate response excluding any demographic information and biometric information.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aadhaar Act 2016</strong>: “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or any other appropriate response sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric information.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p><b><strong>M) Conclusion-</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar&#8217;s purpose was drastically changed. It was supposed to be beneficial for the low-income group by providing subsidies to needy people and remove leakages in the system. The current version of it, which includes mandatory linking to companies and schemes, is <strong>illegal</strong> &amp; risky. The Finance Minister&#8217;s replies to the opposition are super vague and show carelessness while introducing such important act. The disadvantages of this act are contradicting to the aim of Aadhar Act 2016. The government must fix this issue before any major harm happens ( I think all possible negative effects have already happened.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>N)Fun facts-</strong></b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar is not mandatory for <em>VIPs</em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your Jio card registered and activated within 5 minutes because of your biometric data that you provided (in this case it was your fingerprint). At the same time, you handover your <strong>demographic</strong> as well as <strong>biometric</strong> to the Jio company. And this can be misuse (perhaps found to be misused  (9) )</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making Aadhar mandatory is <em><strong>illegal</strong></em>. (I have shown you all evidence about it.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In one rare case of mixed-up identities, 2 men end up with same Aadhaar number. You know, UID means- Unique…(10)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In future Government can ask for <em>DNA</em> of citizen as a biometric data.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not <em>joking</em>. This is what FM Arun Jaitley said –</p>
<blockquote><p>Shri Satpathi wants to know whether DNA can be part of it (Aadhar).The act does not say so. Regulation can expand it.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">In a lot of my conversations with friends, I find not only a great deal of recognition of India’s problems, but also the desire to solve them. From swaraj to hunger to social strife to infrastructure to agriculture, different conversations centre around different problems, depending on the passions of the person I’m talking to. But interestingly, a very large number of these conversations finally arrive at, and get stuck at, an important piece of the puzzle — the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">lack of political will </strong>to solve India’s problems, despite citizens voicing a strong need for solutions to their problems. I find a lot of them questioning whether democracy is really the right system for India.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">What is democracy?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The idea behind democracy is something like this. Citizens have various needs and aspirations, the pursuit of which requires solving certain problems in their society/ economy. To solve these problems, they elect fellow-citizens with the ability and the willingness to represent them (legislature). These representatives, in turn, enact laws that are in sync with the aspirations and needs of the citizens, helping to solve the citizen&#8217;s problems. In short, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">democracy is a bridge between people’s needs &amp; aspirations and the government’s policies. </strong>Democracy’s job is to ensure alignment of the latter to the former.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Good politics comes from listening</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is the main purpose of democracy — that policy-making is closely guided by the needs of citizens. Monarchies and dictatorships have no such bridge between citizens’ needs and govt policies. Any “good” decision made by a dictator is purely based on guesswork as to the citizen’s needs, and not due to representation of the citizen in the policy-making process. This representation makes it compulsory for the govt to listen to the citizen’s voice. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In a democracy, the policy-maker’s main job is to listen to the citizen. Good or bad decisions are merely a consequence </strong>of listening to the citizen. This is what Swaraj means — self-rule of citizens comes from representation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">India needs Swaraj — a more “representative” democracy</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">India’s political system has, for decades now, stopped listening to citizens about their needs and aspirations. The grassroots engagement of citizens with their representatives is totally broken. Most <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">citizens have no access to their local MLA/ MP</strong>, and do not get a chance to meet their representative even once during a 5-year term. Many are not even aware of who their representative is. The citizen’s problems, and more importantly the priority order of those problems, cannot be communicated to lawmakers. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Poor decisions that are disconnected from citizens’ real needs are a natural outcome of such a process</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Things are changing</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The good news: While India needs more representative democracy, certain parties are willing to step forward and provide it. It is important that citizens support such parties. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Citizens must demand certain mandatory minimum levels of interaction with MLAs/ MPs </strong>(e.g. at least a one-hour interaction), at a certain minimum frequency (e.g. at least once a week/ month). Such rules not only ensure better communication and representation (which is the politician’s only job), but they also ensure accountability of politicians to citizens. Such grassroots engagement gives citizens a chance to demand adherence to election manifestos and other promises made. In certain parts of India, newer and younger parties are already highly successful with their attempts at representative democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Ball in citizens’ court</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Citizens judge politicians wrongly. Our ways of judging politicians and political parties involve judging a single personality/ image/ manner of talking, or certain marquee projects/ decisions undertaken by them, without regard to whether those decisions truly reflect the aspirations and needs of citizens.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">We need to judge politicians by how well they do their only job, which is an adherence to representative democracy. It is for a reason that the act governing political parties in India is called the “Representation of People” Act. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Citizens must show their seriousness about representative democracy by voting for parties that voluntarily come up with citizen-engagement rules by themselves, </strong>and show a clear commitment to listening to citizens.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If representative democracy/ <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Swaraj helps a party win elections, then it will catch on quickly among the other parties too</strong>. After all, no party wants to lose elections. And if the rules come from parties themselves in a market-determined manner, the change will be competitive and sustainable, unlike rules that are enforced by the Election Commission or some other external body.</p>

</script></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">So when we have conversations about solutions to India’s problems, let us not judge politicians merely by their words or their image or their stated stance on issues. A politician’s main job is to represent his people, which means engaging with them and listening to them. Let us judge them by their track record of doing that. A natural result of this will be policies that are in sync with the citizen’s needs and aspirations. Good governance and development will happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is said that talking to Bhakts is like talking to a wall, all arguments and responses that BJP supporters aka Bhakts use can summaryied into 4 standard sets for any shortcomings that get highlighted in the Modi government&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>1. The most common one is that the &#8220;Country has been left in such a huge mess by the utter mismanagement and corruption and misadministration of the Congress governments in the last 67 (yes 67, nothing less than that) years that it will take at least a decade to fix issues&#8221;. Of course they just discount that the average GDP growth since 1990-2014 with the old formula was better than the average GDP growth of 2014-2017. And yeah, IITs, NITs, BARC, ISRO, etc. all dropped from a planet of the Alpha Centauri solar system.</p>

<p>2. The second response is that Indians are to be blamed for it. The Swacch Bharat movement started by Modi was one of the most brilliant steps that he ever took. Not only did he hand the accountability back to the citizens, he also raised about Rs 1000 Crore every financial year for cleaning the country. But there were no measures taken to make the municipalities or the state governments more accountable. Of course, he is not accountable for anything that&#8217;s wrong in India, as per these Bhakts and BJP supporters.</p>

<p>3. The third response is to just pooh-pooh the claims. You see, things are not as bad as the &#8216;Presstitutes&#8217; are claiming it to be! Demonetization killed no one. There are no job losses. The industries are working super fine. Kashmiris are now loving Indians more. Nepal is not moving towards China. India is not the most corrupt nation in Asia. Saas Bahu serials are the UNESCO certified best in the world. Anti-national JNU students are to be blamed for all the problems in the country. And so on.</p>
<p>4. The final one is, the news is actually a good thing! CBI not being given more autonomy is actually a good thing as it would be against democratic structures of India. India not having a Lokpal is actually a good thing because PM should be supreme. Corruption being legalized due to <a href="https://youtu.be/J-2oYWhGCZg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finance Bill is good for the country</a>i. Whistle Blower laws being diluted is actually a good thing because they interfere in the governance. Destruction of RTI is actually a good thing because it slows down bureaucracy!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we say, You can awaken a sleeping person, but not someone who is pretending to be asleep&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="alignnone">It is important to connect the dots to take the right stance on Adani&#8217;s coal mine.</p>
<p>In 2014, India has seen the costliest election campaign in its history. India’s Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi used Adani’s chartered flights for his campaign.</p>
<figure id="attachment_355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-355" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-355 size-medium" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/adani-jet-modi-300x273.jpg" alt="Modi boarding Adani's flight. Know how Modi, Australia and Adani's coal mine link together.

<p>Many political parties in India do not reveal their source of funding and they <a href="https://thewire.in/106366/why-there-is-an-urgent-need-to-bring-political-parties-under-the-ambit-of-rti/">do not come under Right to Information act</a>. Meaning, there is no way to know what their source of funding is.</p>
<p><strong>Adani’s wealth tripled from 1.9 billion to 6 billion in just 8 months after Modi’s win.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/business/modi-visit-adani-bharti-get-bulk-of-deals-worth-22bn-with-china-inc/story-QTBxui5MDrHXzdjXtM8FxK.html">Adani bagged multiple deals with Modi&#8217;s support</a> during their visits to different countries.</p>
<p>Modi was part of the meeting between State bank of India and Adani where an MOU(Memorandum of Understanding) was signed for a 1 billion $ loan for Adani’s carmichael mine. This was signed disregarding the fact that the company&#8217;s ability to service its debt is doubtful. The group then had a debt of more than Rs 65,000 crore.</p>
<p>Modi met Queensland premier Campbell Newman in Brisbane, which lead to a commitment from the Queensland state government to take short-term, minority stakes in Adani Group’s rail and port infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>When Modi was campaigning for India’s Prime Ministerial candidate, around the same time India has seen one of the biggest anti corruption movements. During the elections Modi promised to bring back black money stashed in Swiss banks within 100 days of coming into power. Nothing happened so far.</p>
<p>One of the key points in Modi’s agenda during his election campaign was to eliminate corruption if he came to power.</p>

<p>After he won the elections, Modi kept his promise in forming a Special Investigation Team(SIT) to dig into corruption scandals. When SIT investigated, ironically, the biggest scandal they found was, Gautam Adani&#8217;s. One of the Modi’s closest associates with fraud charges of 5000 crore rupees due to illegal hike in coal prices to avoid tax.</p>

Where&#8217;s the Investigation Going?&#8221; &#8212; The Wire" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>What happened to the SIT after that was not a surprise &#8211;<br />
One of the officer’s heading the case in Ahmedabad was raided by CBI accusing him of owning disproportionate assets. Failing to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. 2 senior officials were forced out of the agency.</p>
<p>In 2013 &#8211; Sunita Narain (Director General of the center for science and environment) found incontrovertible evidence of Environmental clearance(EC) damages at Adani&#8217;s mine. In her report she requested cancellation of EC for North port of Adani&#8217;s Mundra project and setting up Environmental relief fund(ERF) of 200 crore rupees to remediate the environmental damages incurred.</p>
<p>Later, in 2015 the new secretary completely rules out ERF and extends EC till 2019</p>
<p>Adani’s company in India is accused of inflating coal prices to avoid tax,<br />
intense lobbying, illegally mining of iron ore, broke export rules, tax laws, willful violations, multiple shell companies, bribing, environment breaches, destroying 75 hectares Mangroves and clearly violated environmental clearance conditions.</p>
<p>Despite having such heinous background, why would our Prime Minster give such intense support to Adani which is eventually going to impact common man of India?</p>
<p>We should not ignore the evidence suggesting the association between political parties and businesses. Their relationship is symbiotic. These both want to mutually benefit each other. The motivations are clearly evident how much ever you try to ignore it.</p>
<p>The whole Adani&#8217;s coal mine project in Australia seems to be built up on lies and contradictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>False claim of 10,000 jobs</li>
<li>Indian underdeveloped community uplift.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these claims are false. <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/adani-mine-queensland-jobs-figures-wont-reflect-mass-employment/news-story/19c82426791bb5788b9bc9c037140207">The predicted jobs are around 1400</a>. The Indian underdeveloped community is far from basic necessities like food, health and shelter. It is beyond their reach to afford the electricity that is produced by coal from Adani&#8217;s coal mine in Australia. These are similar lies that are being flooded on us before and after Modi&#8217;s win.</p>
<p>The common man&#8217;s basic needs are used as a mantra to lure people to believe them. There are many reasons to believe that the desperation to build the Adani&#8217;s coal mine in Australia is to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GetUpAustralia/videos/10154754461391455/?hc_ref=ARTDC_sr-Ga-opeI-hSTKFLd4It3w8OcIi4-cSg4dRD4z4sgWD3vcg0eFIS10XqF9EQ">save himself from bankruptcy</a> due to huge amounts of debts. Modi seems to be willing to go to any lengths to save his dear friend.</p>
<p>What is happening in India in terms of growth and development also corroborate to there facts above.</p>
<p>With globalization, politics in one country is hugely impacting decisions in other countries too. Indians and Australians should come together to stop these horrible decisions and selfish acts by politicians and send a strong message across to not only both these countries but also the world.</p>
<p><strong>NO MORE LIES.</strong></p>
