										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is said that talking to Bhakts is like talking to a wall, all arguments and responses that BJP supporters aka Bhakts use can summaryied into 4 standard sets for any shortcomings that get highlighted in the Modi government&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>1. The most common one is that the &#8220;Country has been left in such a huge mess by the utter mismanagement and corruption and misadministration of the Congress governments in the last 67 (yes 67, nothing less than that) years that it will take at least a decade to fix issues&#8221;. Of course they just discount that the average GDP growth since 1990-2014 with the old formula was better than the average GDP growth of 2014-2017. And yeah, IITs, NITs, BARC, ISRO, etc. all dropped from a planet of the Alpha Centauri solar system.</p>

<p>2. The second response is that Indians are to be blamed for it. The Swacch Bharat movement started by Modi was one of the most brilliant steps that he ever took. Not only did he hand the accountability back to the citizens, he also raised about Rs 1000 Crore every financial year for cleaning the country. But there were no measures taken to make the municipalities or the state governments more accountable. Of course, he is not accountable for anything that&#8217;s wrong in India, as per these Bhakts and BJP supporters.</p>

<p>3. The third response is to just pooh-pooh the claims. You see, things are not as bad as the &#8216;Presstitutes&#8217; are claiming it to be! Demonetization killed no one. There are no job losses. The industries are working super fine. Kashmiris are now loving Indians more. Nepal is not moving towards China. India is not the most corrupt nation in Asia. Saas Bahu serials are the UNESCO certified best in the world. Anti-national JNU students are to be blamed for all the problems in the country. And so on.</p>
<p>4. The final one is, the news is actually a good thing! CBI not being given more autonomy is actually a good thing as it would be against democratic structures of India. India not having a Lokpal is actually a good thing because PM should be supreme. Corruption being legalized due to <a href="https://youtu.be/J-2oYWhGCZg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finance Bill is good for the country</a>i. Whistle Blower laws being diluted is actually a good thing because they interfere in the governance. Destruction of RTI is actually a good thing because it slows down bureaucracy!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we say, You can awaken a sleeping person, but not someone who is pretending to be asleep&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Mr. Prime Minister, there is an urgent call for you”, said the Cabinet Secretary as the PM was plotting his next destination on the globe.</p>
<p>“I want to visit Canada in June 2018”, replied the PM</p>
<p>“Canada, your excellency, under the Prime Ministership of Justin Trudeau will be hosting the G7 Annual Summit at that time”, replied the Cabinet Secretary</p>
<p>“Perfect. Make arrangements for me to travel to Canada to attend the G7 Annual Summit”, ordered the PM in a commanding tone.</p>
<p>“But Mr. PM…..”</p>
<p>“Hold on…Justin Trudeau may give me a lecture on quantum computing. Wait, I have a solution. Ask my scientific advisor CM Yogi to join me on that trip as well” said the PM proudly, marveling at his own brain that works faster than even a quantum computer.</p>
<p>“There is a slight problem Mr. PM”</p>
<p>“What? Am I double booked?”</p>
<p>“Well, actually the Canadian PM is already booked”</p>
<p>“Are you his Cabinet Secretary or mine?” the PM was exasperated</p>
<p>“Of Course, it’s my honour to be your Cabinet Secretary, your excellency, but you see Mr. Trudeau is the host of the Group of 7 at the time, so visiting Canada at the same time may not be the best move for you”</p>
<p>“Hmm….so he is double booked. He is hosting both G7 and the Group of 7 at the same time” said the PM thoughtfully, “anyway, tell him I’m coming. Justin is my old chum. He will be excited at the prospect of discussing quantum computing with Yogi and Me” said the self-congratulatory PM</p>
<p>“Sure Mr. PM. What will be the purpose of the visit?” said the secretary crushing his extreme urge to correct the PM</p>
<p>“To attend the G7, you fool!!” his quantum computing brain was losing patience now.</p>
<p>“Of Course Mr. PM, however, there is a small hindrance. You see India is actually not a member of the Group of 7”</p>
<p>“What’s your twitter handle <em>mitr?” </em>asked a peacefully smiling PM</p>
<p>“Oh, you want to follow me sir? It will be an honour. My twitter handle is…”</p>
<p>“Of course not my friend. You deserve a real honour. I’ll make you a household name throughout the country. I’ll pass it on to my old friend Dadhich!!” the PM showed who the boss is.</p>
<p>“With the greatest respect sir, we are neither a part of the Group of 7, nor G7. Both are actually the same thing” mumbled the secretary, clearly shaken by the prospect of Dadhich <em>honouring</em> him.</p>
<p>“You liberal intellectuals don’t learn your lessons, do you? I’ll go to make India a member of the G7. Yogi and I will do their Ghar-Wapasi and rename the group Gandharva 8, or G8 for short! Can you imagine the press coverage I’ll receive! ‘PM extends the Akhand Bharat to G8 and renames it Gandharva 8’, will be the headlines.” PM could hardly control his excitement.</p>
<p>“’Pakistan denied entry into the G8’, will be splashed across all news channels” announced Swamy walking into the PM’s office.</p>
<p>“Pakistan denied entry Mr. Swamy?” asked the perplexed secretary</p>
<p>“Did Pakistan get entry?” questioned Swamy</p>
<p>“No sir, but denied? How about our responsibility towards the truth? How about our conscience?” replied the secretary.</p>
<p>“Has Pakistan been accepted?” asked Swamy</p>
<p>“No sir”</p>
<p>“Would they like to be accepted?” asked the PM</p>
<p>“Yes Sir”</p>
<p>“If they want it, but cannot have it, are they denied of it?” the PM continued</p>
<p>“Yes sir”</p>
<p>“Are we telling the truth?”</p>
<p>“Umm….Yes Mr. Prime Minister”</p>
<p>“Is your conscience in order?”</p>
<p>“Yes Mr. Prime Minister” he sighed.</p>
<p>“There you go” smiled Swamy</p>
<p>“Sir, there is another problem. There is no chance of India getting membership into the G7” the secretary interjected Swamy’s smile</p>
<p>“What would you prefer – achieving something or trying to achieve something?” asked Swamy</p>
<p>“Without doubt achieving something sir” replied the secretary wondering if it was a trick question</p>
<p>“What’s the first step to achieving something?” asked the PM</p>
<p>“Sir making an effort……umm….trying” replied the secretary</p>
<p>“What are we doing?” asked Swamy</p>
<p>“Sir trying, but with no chance for success, unfortunately”</p>
<p>“Can you fault us for trying?” Swamy laughed</p>
<p>“No sir”</p>
<p>“There you go again” replied the PM</p>
<p>“Ethics in order?” questioned PM with a wry smile</p>
<p>“Yes Prime Minister” he gave up</p>
<p>“Go Swamy, call Arnab” directed the PM,</p>
<p>”by the way what was that urgent call you came to see me about?” PM asked the secretary</p>
<p>“Sir the border forces informed that China just built a road in Doklam”, replied the secretary</p>
<p>“Another opportunity, make arrangements for me to fly to Doklam and make sure I have access to an open top jeep for me to stand.” Instructed the PM</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a politically dangerous situation for the country Mr. Prime Minister?”</p>
<p>“Leave politics to me and story-telling to the news channels” said the PM in a commanding tone</p>
<p>“And the governance Mr. PM?” asked the secretary hesitatingly</p>
<p>“Place a phone call for me to Mr. Ambani and turn the news on” replied the PM dismissing the secretary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Arnab on the TV: ‘Good Evening we have exclusive breaking news that Pakistan has been refused membership to the exclusive G7 while India is on the verge of joining as a full member, more details from top sources in the Government to follow after this short commercial break” </em></p>
<p><em>#G7SnubsPakistan read the ticker.</em></p>
