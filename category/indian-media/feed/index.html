<p>Republic TV, the self appointed high decibel self righteous custodian of patriotism is blatantly lying every single night?</p>
<p>Republic&#8217;s prime time &#8220;debate&#8221;(!) starring Arnab Goswami, prominently features a twitter hashtag along with a live count of the number of tweets. Republic promotes upcoming hashtags from as early as 3 PM onwards. Obviously, their aim is to get as many tweets with the hashtag as possible and make it trend.</p>
<h4>The Lies</h4>
<p>The number of tweets displayed on screen during the debate is a blatant lie!<br />
<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/philips-7-w-b22-led-bulb/p/itme2eggvxbzzxfu?pid=BLBE2EGGHSKCQ2FQ&amp;affid=jaykapoor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />
<img class="responsive-image" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vertical.png
" alt="Null" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some examples that illustrate the fake claims by Republic. In each case a screenshot showing the hashtag, count of tweets &amp; timestamp and an extract of all tweets for the hashtag are presented as proof.</p>
<h5>Example 1 &#8211; #CongChaiwalaAttack</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-571 size-medium" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-23-at-00.42.33-300x169.png" alt="Republic TV claims that there were 6226 tweets with the hashtag #CongChaiwalaAttack at 9:47 PM" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-23-at-00.42.33-300x169.png 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-23-at-00.42.33-768x431.png 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-23-at-00.42.33-1024x575.png 1024w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-23-at-00.42.33.png 1684w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-576" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2b-300x119.png" alt="" width="425" height="169" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2b-300x119.png 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2b-768x306.png 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2b-1024x407.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p>Republic&#8217;s Lie : 6228 tweets at 9:47 PM</p>
<p>The Truth : 1476 tweets at 9:47 PM</p>
<h5>Example 2 &#8211; #RahulCrowning</h5>

<p>Republic&#8217;s Lie : 1502 tweets at 9:45 PM</p>
<p>The Truth : 502 tweets at 9:45 PM</p>
<p>The count has been bumped up by exactly 1000 in this example.</p>
<h5>Example 4 &#8211; #SriSriSolution</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-585" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5c-300x173.png" alt="" width="300" height="173" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5c-300x173.png 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5c-768x442.png 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5c-1024x590.png 1024w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5c.png 1694w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-586" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5b-1024x558.png" alt="" width="318" height="173" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5b-1024x558.png 1024w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5b-300x163.png 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5b-768x418.png 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/5b.png 1766w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></p>
<p>Republic&#8217;s Lie : 1374 tweets at 9:34 PM</p>
<p>The Truth : 250 tweets at 9:34 PM</p>
<h5>Example 5 &#8211; #CashForJustice</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-587" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6c-300x173.png" alt="" width="300" height="173" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6c-300x173.png 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6c-768x443.png 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6c-1024x591.png 1024w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6c.png 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-588" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6b.png" alt="" width="349" height="173" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6b.png 2044w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6b-300x149.png 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6b-768x381.png 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/6b-1024x508.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></p>
<p>Republic&#8217;s Lie : 5198 tweets at 9:32 PM</p>
<p>The Truth : 1212 tweets at 9:32 PM</p>
<h4>The Proof</h4>
<p>Here is an extract of every single tweet for the above hashtags up to and beyond the time of Republic&#8217;s lie. The data is available for anyone to verify or count in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4VanjVGLvB3EFZH0tkJB-fPE6OKszTLKHxTJ6FEtmk">this Google Docs spreadsheet</a>.<br />
If Republic is so blatantly lying about this statistic that they prominently display on their primetime shout down, it makes one wonder else they are doing.<br />
In the words of a loud mouthed bully, The Nation Wants To Know : WHY IS REPUBLIC LYING ON LIVE TV EVERY NIGHT?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arnab Goswami is self-proclaimed most &#8216;nationalist&#8217; journalist ever born in India. His TV news channel is also a self-proclaimed independent &#8220;only&#8221; independent new venture. The reality is far from that, here are 7 reasons why every truly nationalist Indian should boycott him and his Republic TV</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>He tries to create outrages over every issue that he likes. This will mean conveniently ignoring any topic which is against the people funding him. Every time a controversy happens against the ruling party, he would need to switch to other issues to bury that topic. What ends up happening is that stuff like Hrithik &#8211; Kangana gets more importance than Amit Shah&#8217;s controversy.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FHoezaay%2Fvideos%2F1540087629412195%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</li>
<li>Arnab Goswami misses many, rather most real issues which actually affect our everyday lives. Forget about any controversy of ruling party for a second. The problem for common Indians is that he also ignores most topics of general importance like petrol price rise, demonetisation, GDP falling, economy falling, Aadhar privacy etc.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block; text-align: center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7410747505660370" data-ad-slot="3826376908"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<ol>
<li>People shout when others refuse to hear them. Shouting must be the last resort, not the first one, as is the case in his panel debates.</li>
<li>Arnab has the volume control of every panelist. He uses that to ensure which panelist can be heard easily by the viewer and which panelist cannot be heard, no matter how much he shouts.</li>
<li>Because of the &#8220;Shout As Loud as You Can&#8221; format of the show, logic takes a back seat, objectivity takes a back seat, even the beauty of the language takes a back seat. A lot can be said using few beautiful words. I have seen Ravish doing that. His soft words hit hard!</li>
<li>His open bias makes it intolerable to consider his news channel serious journalism. What can be a bigger irony, calling themselves the most independent news venture but still being funded by a present member of parliament. This video by Dhruv rathee does a good job of exposing his bias.
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//pQdJq_ohLXQ" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</li>
<li>He tries to make you tense, and once you are over it, and his words stop affecting you, all you hear is noise from a fish market. You find Discovery Channel heavenly!</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="wp-image-328 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PM-Modi-Interview-With-Arnab-Goswami-2016-Funny-300x158.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="236" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PM-Modi-Interview-With-Arnab-Goswami-2016-Funny-300x158.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PM-Modi-Interview-With-Arnab-Goswami-2016-Funny-768x403.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PM-Modi-Interview-With-Arnab-Goswami-2016-Funny-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PM-Modi-Interview-With-Arnab-Goswami-2016-Funny.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7410747505660370"
     data-ad-slot="3826376908"></ins><br />
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>There are more sane, civil ways to indulge in a discussion and debate. And when Ravish started his debates in NDTV Hindi, that was the end of Arnab&#8217;s TV Colloseum for critical thinkers and news watchers like me.</p>
