										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>A) What kind of technology is </strong></b><b><strong>Aadhar?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar collects the demographic as well as biometric data of whoever who has it.  Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act ensures that under the guise of “<em>national security</em>”, the government can access any information <strong>without</strong> providing any explanation to anyone. It does not define what is “national security” so <strong>any reason</strong> can be used to access and use this data. So in short, one can say that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar is a surveillance technology masquerading as secure authentication technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">See the annotation (1) for further reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>B) But at least it is not affecting anyone directly. Then why we should worry?</strong></b></p>
<p>The threat is not only of mass surveillance but there are also some serious drawbacks.  By making Aadhar compulsory, people in rural areas and underprivileged people are facing numerous problems.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.Aadhaar is compulsory for two more groups of citizens – victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, and workers rescued from bonded labor. The court took 15 years to decide who is eligible or not, whether the person is who they are claiming to be and Now, the government wants the victims to prove their identity in this manner again. Same problem with bonded workers. (2)</p>
<p>2.Thousands of pensioners without Aadhaar or bank accounts struck off lists in Rajasthan (3)</p>
<p>3.Jharkhand: Family denied ration over Aadhaar linking, girl starves to death (4)</p>

</script></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>C) Where we do have to link it and what can be its effects?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.You have to link it to your SIM card, pan card, passport, bank account, voter ID, college/university. And if you want benefits of schemes like LPG, MGNREGS, etc. you have to link Aadhar to them also.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2.According to Aadhar act 2016,  “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or any other appropriate response sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric information.”</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">3.Which also means authority with whom you are linking Aadhar can have access to your photograph (which doesn’t come under core-biometrics) and your demographic information which includes as name, date of birth, address and &#8220;other relevant information&#8221; of an individual. It explicitly excludes race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history.</p>
<p>4.Well, this is legal (but a worrying) way to give our personal details to authority. But there are other ways also.. Like:-  Aadhaar data of 130 million, bank account details leaked from govt websites: Report  (5)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">5.To be fair, two safeguards are in place in the Aadhaar Act. One is that the requesting entity must inform you about the use it proposes to make of your identity information.( But who reads the fine print of the terms and conditions when buying a sim card, or before clicking “I agree” when installing new software?) The second safeguard is that the requesting entity cannot publish or display your Aadhaar number (or your core biometric information, but that is not accessible to a requesting entity in the first place).</p>
<p>6.Note, however, that nothing prevents a requesting entity from publishing or displaying other identity information, as long as it has informed the concerned person.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But wait&#8230;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">7.The Clause 33 (2) states that an official with the rank of <b><strong>Joint Secretary or higher</strong></b> may access a person&#8217;s identity information including core biometric information if the official has an order issued in the interest of national security by the central government.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The government has the power to know and use your fingerprints, iris scan for the <em>“National Security”</em>. The recent trend of classifying people as &#8220;Anti Nationals&#8221; by the government-sponsored trolls makes this a huge concern for everyone. So there&#8217;s actually a very high possibility of the happening that you criticize the government, the government framed you as an anti-national and steals your biometric data to use it against you.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-628 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Big_Brother_eye_logo_for_the_16th_UK_series.jpg" alt="aadhar" width="423" height="235" /></p>
<p><b><strong>D) If there are such serious loopholes, why does the Government want to make it mandatory?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Supreme Court, way back in October 2015, clarified that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for any schemes/services other than ration (PDS), employment guarantee (MNREGS), LPG distribution, pension, provident funds (EPF) and Jan Dhan Yojana. (see the highlighted part &#8211; (6) )</p>
<p>2.So today, whatever gov is making mandatory to link this and that with Aadhar is <strong>actually illegal</strong>. And supreme court reminds this to center in last month.  (7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><strong>E) So, is it necessary to link Aadhar with gov schemes?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.As per <em>“Government of India rule”</em>, yes it is <strong>mandatory</strong> to link it to six welfare schemes, PAN cards, and mobile phones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2.Other than these, ALL other schemes/services/benefits for which Aadhaar is being made mandatory go directly against the earlier Supreme Court order. Including the bank account linking.</p>
<p>3.BUT the government continues its assault unabated. Even the regulations they cleared under the act were quite illegal and had many many loopholes. This is where the confusion begins.</p>
<p><b><strong>F)  Does Aadhar violate the fundamental right to privacy or not?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it does!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>G) Then how did the Aadhaar Act pass in Parliament? (read H) &amp; I) also)</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was passed with shrewdness.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">First, it was introduced in the Budget session of 2016 as a <strong>money bill</strong>. But Aadhar is not a money bill in any sense.</p>
<p><b><strong>H) What are money bills then?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.Bills which exclusively contain provisions for imposition and abolition of taxes, for the appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund, etc., are certified as Money Bills.</p>
<p>2.And Aadhar has nothing to do with these things. Only the <strong>speaker</strong> has the right to called a bill a money bill, but in case of Aadhar, <em>Mr. Arun Jaitley</em> himself introduce it as the money bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>I) Why was it introduced as Money Bill?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Lok Sabha has majority members of ruling party but not in Rajya Sabha. Mr. Jaitley was aware that if this bill introduced the normal bill it will be debated in Rajya Sabha.</p>
<p>2.So after introducing it as a Money Bill, it will no longer under the control of members of Rajya Sabha. Rajya Sabha members can suggest amendments but Lok Sabha has every right to accept or reject those amendments. Guess what happens in Aadhar bill?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lok Sabha <em>rejected</em> the amendments made by Rajya Sabha members and passed the bill. (8)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But the most dangerous thing is –</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>J) How is Government trying to set bureaucracy (and not democracy) regarding Aadhar Act?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For that, we take a wonderful journey all the way to <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/administrator/uploads/media/AADHAAR/Aadhaar%20Bill,%202016.pdf">Clause 58 on Page 17.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">(1) If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, by order, published in the Official Gazette, make such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this Acts may appear to be necessary for removing the difficulty: Provided that no such order shall be made under this section after the expiry of three years from the commencement of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This clause basically puts in a &#8216;lockdown&#8217; provision. Before that comes into effect, they <strong><em>can make changes</em></strong> in the bill by notification in the Gazette ( a written record of bills which passed as an Act). Basically, bureaucrats will have a free reign over what this bill will do after it is passed by Parliament.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And this is very serious.</p>

<p><b><strong>K) What is the role of ministers in this?</strong></b></p>
<p><strong>Arun Jaitley</strong> admits that he is forcing people to create Aadhar card and to link with Gov schemes (even though it does not follow Supreme Court’s order). –</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD) said the Supreme Court had said in September last year that Aadhaar is not mandatory and wanted to know whether the government was “<strong>forcing</strong>” people to get it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“<b><strong>Yes, we are</strong></b>,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jaitley replied.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/yqmxejgaeg-1490259699.jpeg" width="609" height="274" /></p>
<p>Mr. Narendra Modi as a<strong> CM of Gujrat</strong> thoughts that Aadhar there is no vision in this scheme-</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Aadhaar, neither the Team that I met nor PM could answer my Qs on security threat it can pose. There is no vision, only political gimmick</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 8, 2014</p>
<p><b><strong>L) So who is really responsible for this? UPA or NDA government?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Aadhar card or  National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 (NIDAI)  was introduced by the then PM Dr. Manmohan Singh along with Nandan Nilekani as an optional card that wasn’t meant to be mandatory for all citizens. What started out as a simple identity card that would be provided to all Indians.</p>
<p>2.The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016 is a money bill of the Parliament of India. It aims to provide legal backing to the Aadhaar unique identification number project by making it mandatory for people who want benefits subsidies or schemes.</p>
<p>3.The foundational shift that occurred between the National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 (NIDAI) and the Aadhaar Act 2016 is clear from their respective definitions of authentication:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NIDAI 2010</strong>: “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive or negative response or with any other appropriate response excluding any demographic information and biometric information.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aadhaar Act 2016</strong>: “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or any other appropriate response sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric information.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p><b><strong>M) Conclusion-</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar&#8217;s purpose was drastically changed. It was supposed to be beneficial for the low-income group by providing subsidies to needy people and remove leakages in the system. The current version of it, which includes mandatory linking to companies and schemes, is <strong>illegal</strong> &amp; risky. The Finance Minister&#8217;s replies to the opposition are super vague and show carelessness while introducing such important act. The disadvantages of this act are contradicting to the aim of Aadhar Act 2016. The government must fix this issue before any major harm happens ( I think all possible negative effects have already happened.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>N)Fun facts-</strong></b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar is not mandatory for <em>VIPs</em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your Jio card registered and activated within 5 minutes because of your biometric data that you provided (in this case it was your fingerprint). At the same time, you handover your <strong>demographic</strong> as well as <strong>biometric</strong> to the Jio company. And this can be misuse (perhaps found to be misused  (9) )</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making Aadhar mandatory is <em><strong>illegal</strong></em>. (I have shown you all evidence about it.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In one rare case of mixed-up identities, 2 men end up with same Aadhaar number. You know, UID means- Unique…(10)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In future Government can ask for <em>DNA</em> of citizen as a biometric data.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not <em>joking</em>. This is what FM Arun Jaitley said –</p>
<blockquote><p>Shri Satpathi wants to know whether DNA can be part of it (Aadhar).The act does not say so. Regulation can expand it.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To tax or not to tax are the eternal questions before any government and to-pay-or-not-pay is the eternal difficult choice before the people.</p>
<p>Historically taxation has been the cause of much strain between governments and its citizens. It also is one of the main causes of black money and corruption.</p>
<p>What is the solution? Can low taxes solve this problem? But, how will the Government raise revenue for its expenses?</p>
<p>Let us look at some examples of what happens when Governments lower taxes. We will start very near before we go very far.</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

<p>Delhi’s AAP Government&#8217;s experiment in lowering taxes is a recent example closest to home. They became the lowest tax regime in the country when they slashed VAT ( before GST) from 12.5% to 5% in its 2016 budget on many consumer goods like Sweets, savories, snacks, sanitary napkins, shoes, Ready made garments, e-rickshaws marble, kota, dholpur stone, granite, MDF boards &amp; particle boards, laminates, plywood, blackboard and gave subsidies for battery operated cars. This was a bold decision because 65% of the State&#8217;s revenue comes from VAT.</p>
<p>The logic was that compliance will go up and lower taxes will encourage production and consumption.</p>
<p>Instead of revenues falling, the Govt collected 21% higher revenue as compared to previous year. Which is a lot, if you consider that the previous year they registered a growth of 13% and when VAT was higher.</p>
<p>Delhi also became a state with highest GDP in the country in spite of demonetisation which saw a dip in GDP by 2% in the entire country. Furthermore, if low taxes are clubbed with plugging of leakages in revenue then it is a win-win situation for all. For example, the Delhi Jal Board registered increase in revenue in spite giving 20,000 litres/month free water to those who had metered connections. This gave a spurt to people requesting for metered supply and the estimated enormous Rs. 20,000 crore worth of water leakage was plugged. New pipe lines in 263 colonies were laid ( something that had not been done in last 10 years) and revenue through water went up in spite of the free water.</p>
<p>Now let us move from the near to the far. Dr. Ronald D. Rotunda, distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence, <a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2014/06/23/increasing-revenue-lowering-taxes.">writes in an article</a> defending low taxation, “It is said that tax has two purposes: to raise revenue for the Government and to reduce activity of the people. For eg, alchohol, tobacco etc is taxed high not so much to increase revenue but to discourage activity that is taxed, to change behaviour.”</p>

<p>He argues that lower tax rates can produce more revenue than higher rates just as cheaper Wal-Mart makes more money than Tiffany &amp; Co. When USA lowers the capital gains rate, it collects more than when it raises it, he writes.</p>
<p>So also, high taxes makes people go in for secure investment rather than investing in business which carries risk factors or they simply take their monies to safer heavens resulting in cat-and-mouse chase between people and Governments across the globe as the recent Paradise Paper or earlier more such exposes reveal.</p>
<p>Daniel Mitchell, former McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy writes, “ There is a distinct pattern throughout American history: When tax rates are reduced, the economy’s growth rate improves and living standards increase. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/node/18247/print-display.">Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue</a></p>
<p>Therefore, when there was a successful experiment of the Delhi Govt right under their nose, one wonders why the Prime Minister and Finance minister opted for turning India into the highest paying GST in the world, especially since the nation is reeling under demonetisation and fallen GDP.</p>
<p>Lower lax rates will lift sagging sentiments, spurt investments and maybe prove that Indians are not inherently dishonest, as the Delhi AAP experiment has proved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the night of 8th November, all 500, 1000 notes were demonetised. This Demonetization shook the nation overnight. Our Prime Minister said all black money kept in cash would become useless, black money hoarders would now have to burn away their stashes or throw them in the river. Like any other common Indian, I thought this might be a great idea and congratulated Modi for it. But it took just a day of research to realise how many loopholes had been left in this scheme. on 12th November, I made this video exposing the intentional loopholes left in the scheme for corrupt people to get away with.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpQBghg_neY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

</script></p>
<p>Over time it became clear how these loopholes are going to be utilised by every single person having black money. Some started black marketing of buying demonetized currency while others used these loopholes to deposit other&#8217;s people&#8217;s black money in banks. This was proved later this year how almost all demonitized currency had returned to the banks, specifically 99%. What also became clear over time was the negative consequences, disastrous negative consequences this scheme would be having on India&#8217;s economy. Many well known economists and politicians pointed this out. Manmohan Singh and Arvind Kejriwal were among the first ones to speak against this. MMS predicted a fall of 2% of India&#8217;s GDP and called it <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-is-an-organised-loot-Manmohan-Singh/article16693025.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organised loot</a>. AK called it India&#8217;s biggest scam ever as he believed it was meant to write off lakhs of crores of loans of billionares. They both were criticised like hell for it initially, but as time passed by, people realised how true they were. On the other hand, the BJP and PM Modi kept chest thumping on their apparent fight against Corruption through demonetization. They even went on exaggerating it&#8217;s potential benefits, from stopping terrorist attacks to becoming cashless. It was around a couple of months that DeMo became a joke that it was a solution to all problems. Anyone opposing it was labelled as anti national and reminded about Siachen ke jawan. That&#8217;s when i had released a video faking about how Demonetization stopped global warming.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gtzg10ge4Po?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<script>

</script></p>
<p>Over the months, all potential positive benefits turned out to be sham. Neither the corruption reduced, nor the fake currency stopped printing. Cashless usage reduced to pre-demonetization era after February 2017. As for the Black money, RBI stopped giving out details fearing public backlash for months. Indian army faced one of the worst terrorst attacks in the same month as demonetisation, and later one of the worst month for casualties in April 2017. GDP loss began to reflect in the numbers, job losses happened in millions, businesses were closed down, more than 150 people even died during this whole event. All through, govts goalposts kept shifting. It was in August this year that they finally revealed the data and Demonetisation was proved to be a disaster.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrPLI029Jic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I participated in a TV debate on Mirror Now news channel on this topic and then exposed all their nonsense excuses to make Demonetization look like a success later in this video.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QiurIHoSbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Estimates of total loss of money to the country range from 4 Lakh Crore to 8 Lakh Crore. Regardless of the actual figure, its no doubt that Demonetization is much bigger than any existing scam done in India till now. Ironically enough, the BJP has said that they will do another one of their &#8216;grand celebration&#8217; on the one year anniversary of Demonetization, which they have called as &#8216;anti-black money&#8217; day. The day black money was converted to white.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Mr. Prime Minister, there is an urgent call for you”, said the Cabinet Secretary as the PM was plotting his next destination on the globe.</p>
<p>“I want to visit Canada in June 2018”, replied the PM</p>
<p>“Canada, your excellency, under the Prime Ministership of Justin Trudeau will be hosting the G7 Annual Summit at that time”, replied the Cabinet Secretary</p>
<p>“Perfect. Make arrangements for me to travel to Canada to attend the G7 Annual Summit”, ordered the PM in a commanding tone.</p>
<p>“But Mr. PM…..”</p>
<p>“Hold on…Justin Trudeau may give me a lecture on quantum computing. Wait, I have a solution. Ask my scientific advisor CM Yogi to join me on that trip as well” said the PM proudly, marveling at his own brain that works faster than even a quantum computer.</p>
<p>“There is a slight problem Mr. PM”</p>
<p>“What? Am I double booked?”</p>
<p>“Well, actually the Canadian PM is already booked”</p>
<p>“Are you his Cabinet Secretary or mine?” the PM was exasperated</p>
<p>“Of Course, it’s my honour to be your Cabinet Secretary, your excellency, but you see Mr. Trudeau is the host of the Group of 7 at the time, so visiting Canada at the same time may not be the best move for you”</p>
<p>“Hmm….so he is double booked. He is hosting both G7 and the Group of 7 at the same time” said the PM thoughtfully, “anyway, tell him I’m coming. Justin is my old chum. He will be excited at the prospect of discussing quantum computing with Yogi and Me” said the self-congratulatory PM</p>
<p>“Sure Mr. PM. What will be the purpose of the visit?” said the secretary crushing his extreme urge to correct the PM</p>
<p>“To attend the G7, you fool!!” his quantum computing brain was losing patience now.</p>
<p>“Of Course Mr. PM, however, there is a small hindrance. You see India is actually not a member of the Group of 7”</p>
<p>“What’s your twitter handle <em>mitr?” </em>asked a peacefully smiling PM</p>
<p>“Oh, you want to follow me sir? It will be an honour. My twitter handle is…”</p>
<p>“Of course not my friend. You deserve a real honour. I’ll make you a household name throughout the country. I’ll pass it on to my old friend Dadhich!!” the PM showed who the boss is.</p>
<p>“With the greatest respect sir, we are neither a part of the Group of 7, nor G7. Both are actually the same thing” mumbled the secretary, clearly shaken by the prospect of Dadhich <em>honouring</em> him.</p>
<p>“You liberal intellectuals don’t learn your lessons, do you? I’ll go to make India a member of the G7. Yogi and I will do their Ghar-Wapasi and rename the group Gandharva 8, or G8 for short! Can you imagine the press coverage I’ll receive! ‘PM extends the Akhand Bharat to G8 and renames it Gandharva 8’, will be the headlines.” PM could hardly control his excitement.</p>
<p>“’Pakistan denied entry into the G8’, will be splashed across all news channels” announced Swamy walking into the PM’s office.</p>
<p>“Pakistan denied entry Mr. Swamy?” asked the perplexed secretary</p>
<p>“Did Pakistan get entry?” questioned Swamy</p>
<p>“No sir, but denied? How about our responsibility towards the truth? How about our conscience?” replied the secretary.</p>
<p>“Has Pakistan been accepted?” asked Swamy</p>
<p>“No sir”</p>
<p>“Would they like to be accepted?” asked the PM</p>
<p>“Yes Sir”</p>
<p>“If they want it, but cannot have it, are they denied of it?” the PM continued</p>
<p>“Yes sir”</p>
<p>“Are we telling the truth?”</p>
<p>“Umm….Yes Mr. Prime Minister”</p>
<p>“Is your conscience in order?”</p>
<p>“Yes Mr. Prime Minister” he sighed.</p>
<p>“There you go” smiled Swamy</p>
<p>“Sir, there is another problem. There is no chance of India getting membership into the G7” the secretary interjected Swamy’s smile</p>
<p>“What would you prefer – achieving something or trying to achieve something?” asked Swamy</p>
<p>“Without doubt achieving something sir” replied the secretary wondering if it was a trick question</p>
<p>“What’s the first step to achieving something?” asked the PM</p>
<p>“Sir making an effort……umm….trying” replied the secretary</p>
<p>“What are we doing?” asked Swamy</p>
<p>“Sir trying, but with no chance for success, unfortunately”</p>
<p>“Can you fault us for trying?” Swamy laughed</p>
<p>“No sir”</p>
<p>“There you go again” replied the PM</p>
<p>“Ethics in order?” questioned PM with a wry smile</p>
<p>“Yes Prime Minister” he gave up</p>
<p>“Go Swamy, call Arnab” directed the PM,</p>
<p>”by the way what was that urgent call you came to see me about?” PM asked the secretary</p>
<p>“Sir the border forces informed that China just built a road in Doklam”, replied the secretary</p>
<p>“Another opportunity, make arrangements for me to fly to Doklam and make sure I have access to an open top jeep for me to stand.” Instructed the PM</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a politically dangerous situation for the country Mr. Prime Minister?”</p>
<p>“Leave politics to me and story-telling to the news channels” said the PM in a commanding tone</p>
<p>“And the governance Mr. PM?” asked the secretary hesitatingly</p>
<p>“Place a phone call for me to Mr. Ambani and turn the news on” replied the PM dismissing the secretary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Arnab on the TV: ‘Good Evening we have exclusive breaking news that Pakistan has been refused membership to the exclusive G7 while India is on the verge of joining as a full member, more details from top sources in the Government to follow after this short commercial break” </em></p>
<p><em>#G7SnubsPakistan read the ticker.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this video, I talk about why the petrol price have risen this record high. Important thing to note here is the change in crude oil prices which has happened in the past few years. In 2012/2013, it had risen very high to $109 per barrel but came down in the last three years since then. Another important chart here is the the breakdown of the petrol tax which you are paying nowadays.</p>
