<p>Note: I request the reader to clear their minds before going through this article. For few minutes, just try to unlearn everything that you have been taught since your childhood. I am just presenting a different perspective. It is not about right or wrong. Just read it and think about it.</p>

<p>NASA&#8217;s Voyager took this picture of earth from a distance of 4 billion miles, famously known as &#8216;Pale Blue Dot&#8217;. I insist you, read this amazing <a href="http://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=682">speech </a>by Astronomer Carl Sagan on it. It shows how Earth is just a pixel in this universe. Look at the above picture and you will realize how minute we are. The universe doesn&#8217;t even care about our existence. And though our actions and existence are insignificant from the Universe&#8217;s point of view, they have their own significance in the context of this &#8216;Pale Blue Dot&#8217;. Being the most intelligent species on earth it is our duty to take care of this planet and to create a sustainable and humane world. A world which is driven by logic and rationale. We, instead, embraced a world full of ideologies.</p>
<p>Leave the world aside, we have different ideologies in our country. Ideologies are driving our society. Do we even realize the impact of these ideologies? for example, in every newsroom debate, we witness panelists blaming and taming each other’s ideology. Most of them don’t have logic to support their claim. They just refer texts which were written a long time ago or the words of their ancestors. We failed to realize that these teachings come from humans like us. Our ancestors might have been wrong and even if they were right, there is a great chance that their principles/teachings might be irrelevant in present situation. Same goes with ancient texts, they were written by humans and might be irrelevant in the present scenario. So, why not apply logic instead of ideologies?</p>
<p>I believe ideologies are the reason for our conflicts. A person possessed by certain ideology can go to any extent to defend his ideology irrespective of the logical explanation. They already have an answer, they are just creating a proper explanation to support their answer. American president Bill Clinton, during an interview, shared his thoughts on ideology <em><strong>&#8220;The problem with an ideology is that it gives the answer before you look at the evidence. So you have to mold the evidence to get the answer that you have already decided”</strong></em>. We just want to defend our beliefs and ideological principles. Ideology suppress our free thinking, it won’t allow us to think rationally. Our scope of thinking is narrowed down by ideologies. Those who are possessed by ideologies don’t have a conscience left to question themselves.</p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"

</script></p>
<p>There might be a community or a group or a political party whose ideology suits the current situation but there is a huge possibility that their ideology will be outdated in near future. When such time comes you don’t have the free will or courage to question that ideology because those ideologies brainwashed you. Ideologies are static while logic is dynamic. Our logic is based on current situation while Ideologies are fixed set of rules.</p>
<div>Just Like ideology, our constitution is consist of a set of rules and principles. But our constitution is continuously updating with time and changing society. So, why do we stuck with those static ideologies don’t you think that our ideologies should be updated? Well, updated ideology is also logical. When I say ideologies, I mean static set of rules, don&#8217;t get confused with the word.</div>
<div></div>
<div> It is difficult for us to question our own ideology which was taught to us since our childhood. Our ideologies were decided even before our birth. We feel uncomfortable or offended if someone questions it. In this race of ideologies we have lost our humanity, let&#8217;s leave those ideologies and claim our humanity again.I personally believe that without ideology, the world will be a better place or at least when we prioritize logic instead of ideology in our thought process and decision making.It&#8217;s time we realize that this &#8216;Pale Blue Dot&#8217; is suffering because of our arrogance.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This title is no exaggeration. Forget multiple crackers , Just one firecracker, one phooljhadi generates as much smoke as 74 cigarettes if you stand within one feet from it. This has been concluded by a 2016  <a href="http://www.ers-education.org/home/browse-all-content.aspx?idParent=155716">study</a> by Chest Research Foundation in Pune. It analyzed six different crackers– the snake , a 1000 cracker ladi,  phuljhadi,  pul-pul , anar  and chakri for their PM 2.5 pollution levels. These pollution levels were then compared to average PM 2.5 generated by a cigarette by <a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/smoke-from-firecracker-snake-464-cigarettes-and-other-diwali-stories-53583">India Spend</a>. It then gave the following estimations of smoke generated by firecrackers compared to cigarettes &#8211;</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />
<!-- Main ad --><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block;" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7410747505660370" data-ad-slot="2040431219" data-ad-format="auto"></ins><br />

</script></p>
<p>1. One Chakri generates as much smoke as 68 cigarettes</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-417 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers.jpeg" alt="crackers" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers.jpeg 400w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></p>
<p>2. This seemingly harmless cracker is one of the most dangerous ones. One Snake cracker generates as much smoke as 464 cigarettes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-418 " src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks.jpg" alt="crackers" width="590" height="311" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks.jpg 759w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></p>
<p>3. One anar cracker generates as much smoke as 34 cigarettes. This is comparatively lower than other crackers because one stands around 3 feet away from anar when it is bursting instead of the usual one feet.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-419 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar.jpg" alt="crackers" width="725" height="408" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar.jpg 1920w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. One ladi cracker of 1000 generates as much smoke as 277 cigarettes. Even when standing further away, a ladi is one of the most polluting crackers.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-420 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="crackers" width="715" height="402" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault.jpg 1920w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S0 assuming on average if a cracker emits smoke as much as 100 cigarettes and you burst just 20 crackers this Diwali then you will end up inhaling as much smoke as 2000 cigarettes. With regards to pollution levels, <span style="background-color: #f6d5d9;">India </span>has a 24-hour mean standard of 60 µg/m³ for PM 2.5 pollution, while the WHO has a lower standard of 25 µg/m³. When bursting crackers, this pollution level is broken massively, where a single cracker during it&#8217;s duration of bursting is generating upto 60,000  µg/m³ of PM 2.5 pollution. Now whether you agree with <a href="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/firecrackers-ban-good-bad/">Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to ban firecrackers</a> or not, that is a talk for some other time..</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

<script>

</script></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone who thinks that bursting crackers is not a big source of pollution and like to blame it on other things, then think again! In no other event across the year, are your lungs this vulnerable to pollution. Overall air pollution may be caused by a variety of things from burning fields to cars or industries. But none of these other factors are ever affecting you directly by being in close proximity to you. This one day of Diwali will have an unprecedented toll on your health, should you choose to burst crackers. Fortunately enough, your health is in your own control. These distastrous health effects are only caused when you are in close proximity to crackers, that means you are bursting them yourself. So, do your lungs a favour this diwali, by staying away from crackers and advise the same to your family and friends. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The problem in Mumbai is not about immigration. It is about the poor people from other sick states. The poor people who live in dirty filthy slums and destroy the beauty of the Maximum city.</p>
<p>Take Dubai for example. It is so clean, you don&#8217;t see any poor anywhere, in fact most people understand there is no poverty in Dubai at all.</p>
<p>Mumbai is the financial capital of the country, or was, till Delhi/NCR took over last year, but still it pays the most tax in the country. Well, let&#8217;s forget that the headquarter of most companies which do business all over the country are situated in Mumbai so the taxes by these companies have the Mumbai address.</p>
<p>So, if Mumbai is so rich, and pays so much of tax and the whole damn country is relying on this maximum city, why can&#8217;t it be as squeaky clean and disciplined as Dubai?</p>
<p>Dubai has dealt well with the poverty. It calls the poor immigrants from other countries, ensures they don&#8217;t get their passports back, dumps this cheap or free labour in concentration camps, sucks out the blood and sweat, and ensures that the world doesn&#8217;t see them.</p>
<p>Mumbai needs to emulate. See, Mumbai is surviving on cheap labour imported by the BIMARU (Sick) states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. If there was no cheap labour, the profit margins will be affected and profit is everything for the businesses which run out of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Everyone knows when the cheap labour came that, if decent living was given to them then the labour would not be cheap anymore. So, the city has thrown 54% of its population in the slums. In these slums, the men labour out, the women end up in Chandni Bars, the children go to filthy MCD schools. MCD &#8211; A state with a budget of Rs 36K Crore! These poor filthy immigrants from other BIMARU states don&#8217;t deserve better schools and hospitals so the administrators, which mostly are not immigrants but locals, pocket in all these money and then file a defamation case on whomsoever puts the blame on them.</p>
<p>The poorly educated poor immigrants never really get out of the wheel of poverty and remain undisciplined. As Mumbai is not as disciplined as Dubai, these people keep on ruining the lovely city of Mumbai.</p>
<p>Mumbai would be better than Dubai if all these immigrants from the sick states leave. It doesn&#8217;t matter that the 70% of immigrants are not from these sick states but from Maharashtra itself. A state which is reeling since decades in water shortage, where the politicians have been looting in the name of irrigation. If the irrigation scam gets stopped the Maharashtrian farmer can live a comfortable life in his own village, reducing the load on Mumbai, but let&#8217;s not look into it right now.</p>
<p>If all immigrants from the sick states leave, Mumbai will be better than Dubai &#8211; It would be Detroit! Detroit &#8211; A once booming city which has kind of died right now, but at least it has got rid of all the immigrants!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-374" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-374" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey.jpg" alt="Mumbai" width="318" height="424" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey.jpg 1072w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tumey-769x1024.jpg 769w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-374" class="wp-caption-text">Detroit&#8217;s decline captured in google street view</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the capital of the biggest sick state &#8211; Lucknow, now has a functioning Metro of 8.5 KM whereas the maximum city has a functioning metro of 11.40 KM. I am amazed at the kind of focus Maharashtra has put in order to improve the public transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s keep the immigrants in Mumbai for just a bit more, till the 3600 Crore Statue of the Great Shivaji gets constructed (as his forts rot away) and then Mumbai can have an immigration policy where work visas are given to people from BIMARU states.</p>

<figure id="attachment_362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-362" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-362 size-full" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali-pollution-759-1.jpg" alt="firecracker" width="759" height="422" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali-pollution-759-1.jpg 759w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali-pollution-759-1-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-362" class="wp-caption-text">Firecrackers and pollution</figcaption></figure>
<p class="qtext_para">A good friend of mine in Delhi was very tense. Her son had developed severe symptoms of asthma at a young age and she was feeling helpless. Although I never mentioned to her, she said that she would understand if I chose to settle in Canada.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">A friend of mine was furious. He saw smog engulf his room. His kid was choking and there was little that he could do. When this judgement was released, not only did he welcome it, he also openly abused on Facebook anyone who was critical to it.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">The pollution levels of Delhi are <b>insane</b>. If WHO says 50 PPM is safe, the city would be at 600+! An American diplomat literally ran for his life, away from Delhi, back to USA.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">I saw a Diwali video my parents sent me via WhatsApp. I have lived in about 9 cities in India, but the amount of crackers Delhiites burn (or blast) is insane. My parents live on 10th floor, the ideal height for the sky bursters to burst, and they kept on bursting right in front of their balcony!</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">All said and done, I feel this judgement really won’t achieve anything apart from infuriating the religious zealots and giving fake assurance to the ecology lovers. Here is why:</p>
<p class="qtext_para"><b>WHAT POLLUTES DELHI’S AIR</b></p>
<ol>
<li>ROAD DUST: 50% [Solution : <b>Grass the footpaths </b>]</li>
<li>INDUSTRIES: 23% [Solution : <b>Regulate the Industries </b>]</li>
<li>LOCAL DUST GENERATION: 20% [Solution : <b>Plant more trees </b>]</li>
<li>VEHICULAR: 7% [Solution :<b> Improve Public Transport </b>]</li>
</ol>
<p class="qtext_para">The Delhi’s air is literally screwed all around the year. During the Autumn, crops are burnt in the farms and the crop ash ends up falling inside Delhi. This makes Delhi a gas chamber ~ <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-pollution-nightmare-crop-burning-in-nearby-states-begins/story-djXJY8W0Ugzm8dgsxmbN0K.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brace for air pollution in Delhi as crop burning starts in neighbouring states</a></span></p>
<p>Regardless, I feel that every Indian and especially people living in NCR and Delhi should support the current ban by Supreme court. It may not clean Delhi&#8217;s gas chamber like air but it will certainly stop it from making it even worse like last year when Delhi broke record for registering a pollution level of 999, which was the maximum any PM 2.5 measuring scale could measure.</p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p class="qtext_para">What I observed during Diwali in Chennai was that although the crackers were more expensive, they were not generating a lot of smoke. In Mississauga, Canada, the government had non stop fireworks for 15 minutes right in front of where I live and hardly any smoke was generated. More firework was burnt than a colony burns in 2 hours in some Indian city.</p>
<p>Better quality but expensive crackers will go a long way in decreasing pollution during Diwali</p>
<p class="qtext_para">Outright banning firecrackers in Diwali might be an experiment, but it’s not a solution. It would lead to black marketing of firecrackers, more corruption, contempt of court and bad blood among the Indians.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">A more pragmatic approach would have been to pick the highest to lowest polluters (mentioned above) one at a time.</p>
<p class="qtext_para">And definitely not increasing the Metro Fares!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the very long history of Human civilization, many languages have survived, many have thrived, many have died a slow death. Few think that Hindi is pushing other languages to oblivion. But how true is that?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, languages like Sanskrit, Latin and even Persian were thriving. Today, they are confined to a much smaller dominion.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Hindi_devnagari.png" alt="Hindi" /><br />
Is Hindi causing the death of other languages? First of all, are we really speaking Hindi in our daily lives?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t speak Hindi any more. We speak Hindustani. It&#8217;s a language which is a mixture of Hindi, Urdu and Persian. Whenever you speak pure Hindi, you receive a look of amusement even from the so called Hindi speakers.</p>
<p>Now, is Hindustani destroying other languages? Hindustani has thrived mainly due to two aspects &#8211; Simplicity and Acceptance. It has slowly given up complicated words from both Urdu and Sanskrit and has adopted easier words. This is also the main reason why English is most popular in the world.</p>
<p>Any simple language will spread on its own. This is the law of nature and nothing can supersede it. It can be slowed down, but never stopped. You cannot get back Latin and kick away English. English was once a language of poor and commoner and was associated with poverty and still it spread because it kept on adopting words from different languages. This acceptance is also the primary reason why English is a phonetically incorrect language.</p>
<p>Due to a multiple reasons, English has been unable to penetrate the rural India, specially in North India. Hence it would be foolish to expect that English can take place of Hindustani in India within a span of a few more decades.</p>
<p>Hindustani is spreading and will keep on spreading as it keeps on accepting words from different languages. Any language which is not open to accepting vocabulary of other languages will die away with time.</p>
<p>Language is essentially the medium of communication and Humans tend to bend towards ease and simplicity.</p>
<p>No matter how much Indian government pushes India towards pure Hindi, it would fail. With time, even the pure Hindi might die.</p>
