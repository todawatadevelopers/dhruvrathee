										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember the manifesto of BJP for Gujarat Elections? Maybe you would remember the promises of Congress party if they win Gujarat? No? Neither do I or majority of people or the media.</p>
<p>Elections are fought by various political parties to demonstrate why they should be in charge of governance of a country or a state. Therefore, one can conclude that all issues about good and better governance would be the larger conversation during electioneering.</p>
<p>But, no! Everything harmful to good governance is actually the campaign plank of parties in India. The conversation and campaigning in Gujarat elections as usual was to embroil the voters into emotional tangles with stuff like, “neech”, “sex videos”, “Mandir”, “masjid” etc.</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

</script></p>
<p>A concrete example of how low on priority is governance in electioneering can be gauged from the importance given to manifesto by the parties themselves.</p>
<p>The BJP, that is the largest party in power today, released its manifesto a day before the elections. The Cong was slightly better by releasing it 5 days before the elections. BJP’s manifesto has something for the voters to chew on. But Congress party manifesto is like a leaflet drafted by some high school student. The truth is BJP, Congress and our media, all have stopped caring about promises and manifesto. Have a look at the links below to see these two manifestoes.</p>
<p>The voters also don’t seem to miss the most important document for any election. For them too elections is like a heady tamasha.</p>
<p>Neither does the media bring up the subject of party manifesto. Because for them too it’s a lot easier to be part of the tamasha. It requires no research? No need of a good editorial team? So much cheaper and easier to entertain people with political drama of our “Republic”.  The last time someone actually made the effort to track manifesto promises was The Hindu newspaper, which tracked AAP&#8217;s promises after one year. It is perhaps the only media somewhat focusing on this. And worse still, some media resort to lies and fake news for sensationalism or toe the line of their owners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our 70 years old Republic is faced with some shameful and some explosive facts. According to the 2011 Census, only 4.5% of our country’s population is educated to level of graduate. 32.6% is not even educated up to primary level.</p>

<p>41% of India’s population is below the age of 20 years (2011 Census), 50% of the population is in the 20-59 age group. A mind-boggling number of youth will be in need of jobs. But, instead of creation of jobs, demonetization which plunged the country’s GDP to 5.7% saw retrenchments in many areas. ILO in its World Employment &amp; Social Outlook report in Jan, 2017 said unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7million last year to 17.8 million in 2017. This becomes relevant in the face of BJP poll promise of creating 1 crore jobs every year.</p>
<p>The bursting youth population, sinking job opportunities and drumming up of violent, divisive emotional issues of polarization make for an explosive alchemy which may go out of control.</p>
<p>Then there is environment, civic amenities, infrastructure, health, poverty, agriculture crisis which need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Below are links to the Gujarat State manifestoes of BJP and Congress. Judge for yourself which party has done it’s home-work on what it is promising to deliver to the people. Attached is also the APP manifesto for the 2015 Delhi state election because it is the other emerging national level party. What did it promise and what was fulfilled?</p>
<p>Media, informed groups and voters must focus on Party manifestoes and deliverance if elections are to serve the purpose of getting committed people in power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, Modi won the elections promising wonders for India. Economy would be shining, people would have crores of jobs, Ganga would be clean, criminals and corrupts will be in jail and black money will be back. These were far fetched dreams but every voter at least hoped that there would be some work happening in the right direction, for the progress of our country.</p>
<p>2017 was only the third year of Modi&#8217;s rule and not only do these wonder promises have been burnt to ashes, but they have been publicly mocked and shamed over and over again. And India has taken a big step backward towards regression.</p>

<p>Ganga cleaning barely even started, but the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3800894/How-world-s-dirtiest-river-dirtier-New-study-finds-holy-River-Ganga-contains-POO-pollutants-pesticides-ever.html">Ganga river became dirtier than it ever was</a>. Economy had just started recovering and the Masterstroke of Demonetization crashed it down, causing lakhs of job losses and monetary losses to the country in the magnitude of lakhs of crores of rupees.</p>
<p>The war against corruption was mentioned often in speeches but 2017 was the year when corruption was legalized, at least for political parties. The finance bill passed in March removed the upper limit on political party donation from companies. Foreign funding of parties was legalized, while around the same time, foreign funding of NGOs was blocked. Desperate attempts were made to make the funding more opaque. Who will catch the corrupts, when they&#8217;ll all be hidden under legal protection?</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s Christmas bought even worse news. The overtly publicized 2G Scam, either didn&#8217;t happen or the guilty found their way to escape. Many accusing the judiciary and many more accusing Modi himself for striking a deal with the corrupts for votes. Till now, not a single corrupt politician went to jail under Modi. Corruption whistleblowers and RTI activists also got a huge backstab as respective laws were changed to make life difficult for them.</p>
<p>Law and order took a disastrous turn this year. A wrong number baba turned politician with multiple criminal cases on himself was given the charge for the most populated state in India. Cow related violence broke all records, with 2017 being the deadliest year with over <a href="http://data.indiaspend.com/hate-crime">152 victims </a>across the country. Lynchings, mob violence, riots saw a similar growth in many Modi ruled states. Be it mob violently protesting for another wrong number Baba in Haryana or some government supported people holding movie actors ransom over Padmavati release. These were not isolated incidents, they were a mark of growing intolerance and jobless religious bigots getting offended. Similar violent riots and deaths threats happened over &#8216;Tiger Zinda hai&#8217; and &#8216;Games of Ayodhya&#8217; movies by right wing groups. Muslims were only the beginning, as Christians and Christmas became their next target this year. Modi may not be directly behind all these incidents but he is pretty much Cersei, the Game of Thrones character who funded and appeased to the faith militant for her benefit, which later terribly backfired on her and Kings Landing.</p>

<p>Fake news, propaganda and trolling were the social media highlight of the year. The fake news epidemic reached deadly heights in 2017, when in Jharkhand, several people were lynched based on a Whats app rumor. Later this year, a man was burned alive for revenge of Love Jihad, another phenomena which is more prevalent in what&#8217;s app messages than in real life. BJP IT Cell and right wing pages have been the torchbearers of fake news here, constantly promoting cold blooded murder videos from Mexico and Brazil as Muslims killing Hindus in India. Online trolling and abusing also crossed all limits of craziness when the world came to know that the Indian Prime minister follows many of such trolls and abusers on twitter. The same trolls which mocked the murder of a top journalist, Gauri Lankesh this year. Talking of trolls, India got its very own North Korean TV Channel in the form of Republic TV. Openly funded by a BJP MP, the channel danced on tunes of Modi government to help spread its propaganda, many a times shamelessly using fake news.</p>
<p>Modi personally, maintained his record for being the least accountable PM, never attending a single press conference but giving over 775 one way speeches (not including all the man ki baats) and 2 scripted interviews.</p>
<p>It would be hard for anyone to continue ruling India with this extent of failures, backstabs and U-turns. It would be disaster for Modi the day the people come to know about his ultimate efforts to protect the corrupts and criminals. The only way he can survive would be by placing more faith on the faith militant to brainwash the poor jobless people, fill up their hungry stomachs with communal hatred, who would then vote for their messiah to fight the imaginary anti-nationals. I predict 2018 will see more funding been diverted to propaganda channels, expect more fake news, more statues, more renaming and more appeasement of septons and the faith militant. Expect corruption and criminals to magically disappear in 2018, because Modi has already legalized corruption and promoted the criminals to highest of posts. And of course, expect cleaner and developed India in newspapers and your mobile screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi&#8217;s Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) resumed its action after Aam Aadmi Party formed the government for second time on Feb 14, 2015. After arresting 9 people on Feb 16, An anti corruption app was launched on Feb 19, and anti corruption helpline was relaunched in March. First anti corruption helpline was launched by Aam Aadmi Party during its first 49 days rule. Journey of ACB with Delhi govt, LG office and Central govt was not smooth and there has been many issues/contradictions among different offices. While ACB was spreading its wigs and started digging into bigger scams, politics and power started interfering its operations. There was enough media coverage about ACB actions and I was able to sort the ACB related data available on aapdelhidiary blog. Until Jun 2015, ACB performed multiple arrests, registered corruption cases, phone calls on helpline, opened big scams, arrested Delhi Police officials. Here is a brief list of actions (with source) taken by ACB from Feb 2015 to Jun 2015.</p>

<p>While ACB started digging into big scams including 2002 CNG Fitness Scam and arresting Delhi Police officials, On Jun 8, LG office appointed MK Meena as head of Delhi&#8217;s ACB. Later a corruption complaint was lodged with Delhi Govt against Chief MK Meena.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the head of an organization is accused of corruption, then it is difficult to expect any action (anti-corruption) from head, as it might bite back. This is where ACB collapsed and no major actions/arrests were taken post Jun 2015. There have been few complains and FIR are registered by ACB against DWC and some AAP MLAs.</p></blockquote>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar collects the demographic as well as biometric data of whoever who has it.  Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act ensures that under the guise of “<em>national security</em>”, the government can access any information <strong>without</strong> providing any explanation to anyone. It does not define what is “national security” so <strong>any reason</strong> can be used to access and use this data. So in short, one can say that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar is a surveillance technology masquerading as secure authentication technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">See the annotation (1) for further reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>B) But at least it is not affecting anyone directly. Then why we should worry?</strong></b></p>
<p>The threat is not only of mass surveillance but there are also some serious drawbacks.  By making Aadhar compulsory, people in rural areas and underprivileged people are facing numerous problems.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.Aadhaar is compulsory for two more groups of citizens – victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, and workers rescued from bonded labor. The court took 15 years to decide who is eligible or not, whether the person is who they are claiming to be and Now, the government wants the victims to prove their identity in this manner again. Same problem with bonded workers. (2)</p>
<p>2.Thousands of pensioners without Aadhaar or bank accounts struck off lists in Rajasthan (3)</p>
<p>3.Jharkhand: Family denied ration over Aadhaar linking, girl starves to death (4)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>C) Where we do have to link it and what can be its effects?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.You have to link it to your SIM card, pan card, passport, bank account, voter ID, college/university. And if you want benefits of schemes like LPG, MGNREGS, etc. you have to link Aadhar to them also.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">2.According to Aadhar act 2016,  “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or any other appropriate response sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric information.”</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">3.Which also means authority with whom you are linking Aadhar can have access to your photograph (which doesn’t come under core-biometrics) and your demographic information which includes as name, date of birth, address and &#8220;other relevant information&#8221; of an individual. It explicitly excludes race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history.</p>
<p>4.Well, this is legal (but a worrying) way to give our personal details to authority. But there are other ways also.. Like:-  Aadhaar data of 130 million, bank account details leaked from govt websites: Report  (5)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">5.To be fair, two safeguards are in place in the Aadhaar Act. One is that the requesting entity must inform you about the use it proposes to make of your identity information.( But who reads the fine print of the terms and conditions when buying a sim card, or before clicking “I agree” when installing new software?) The second safeguard is that the requesting entity cannot publish or display your Aadhaar number (or your core biometric information, but that is not accessible to a requesting entity in the first place).</p>
<p>6.Note, however, that nothing prevents a requesting entity from publishing or displaying other identity information, as long as it has informed the concerned person.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But wait&#8230;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">7.The Clause 33 (2) states that an official with the rank of <b><strong>Joint Secretary or higher</strong></b> may access a person&#8217;s identity information including core biometric information if the official has an order issued in the interest of national security by the central government.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The government has the power to know and use your fingerprints, iris scan for the <em>“National Security”</em>. The recent trend of classifying people as &#8220;Anti Nationals&#8221; by the government-sponsored trolls makes this a huge concern for everyone. So there&#8217;s actually a very high possibility of the happening that you criticize the government, the government framed you as an anti-national and steals your biometric data to use it against you.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-628 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Big_Brother_eye_logo_for_the_16th_UK_series.jpg" alt="aadhar" width="423" height="235" /></p>
<p><b><strong>D) If there are such serious loopholes, why does the Government want to make it mandatory?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Supreme Court, way back in October 2015, clarified that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for any schemes/services other than ration (PDS), employment guarantee (MNREGS), LPG distribution, pension, provident funds (EPF) and Jan Dhan Yojana. (see the highlighted part &#8211; (6) )</p>
<p>2.So today, whatever gov is making mandatory to link this and that with Aadhar is <strong>actually illegal</strong>. And supreme court reminds this to center in last month.  (7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><strong>E) So, is it necessary to link Aadhar with gov schemes?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.As per <em>“Government of India rule”</em>, yes it is <strong>mandatory</strong> to link it to six welfare schemes, PAN cards, and mobile phones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">2.Other than these, ALL other schemes/services/benefits for which Aadhaar is being made mandatory go directly against the earlier Supreme Court order. Including the bank account linking.</p>
<p>3.BUT the government continues its assault unabated. Even the regulations they cleared under the act were quite illegal and had many many loopholes. This is where the confusion begins.</p>
<p><b><strong>F)  Does Aadhar violate the fundamental right to privacy or not?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it does!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>G) Then how did the Aadhaar Act pass in Parliament? (read H) &amp; I) also)</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was passed with shrewdness.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">First, it was introduced in the Budget session of 2016 as a <strong>money bill</strong>. But Aadhar is not a money bill in any sense.</p>
<p><b><strong>H) What are money bills then?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">1.Bills which exclusively contain provisions for imposition and abolition of taxes, for the appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund, etc., are certified as Money Bills.</p>
<p>2.And Aadhar has nothing to do with these things. Only the <strong>speaker</strong> has the right to called a bill a money bill, but in case of Aadhar, <em>Mr. Arun Jaitley</em> himself introduce it as the money bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>I) Why was it introduced as Money Bill?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Lok Sabha has majority members of ruling party but not in Rajya Sabha. Mr. Jaitley was aware that if this bill introduced the normal bill it will be debated in Rajya Sabha.</p>
<p>2.So after introducing it as a Money Bill, it will no longer under the control of members of Rajya Sabha. Rajya Sabha members can suggest amendments but Lok Sabha has every right to accept or reject those amendments. Guess what happens in Aadhar bill?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lok Sabha <em>rejected</em> the amendments made by Rajya Sabha members and passed the bill. (8)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But the most dangerous thing is –</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>J) How is Government trying to set bureaucracy (and not democracy) regarding Aadhar Act?</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For that, we take a wonderful journey all the way to <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/administrator/uploads/media/AADHAAR/Aadhaar%20Bill,%202016.pdf">Clause 58 on Page 17.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">(1) If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, by order, published in the Official Gazette, make such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this Acts may appear to be necessary for removing the difficulty: Provided that no such order shall be made under this section after the expiry of three years from the commencement of this Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This clause basically puts in a &#8216;lockdown&#8217; provision. Before that comes into effect, they <strong><em>can make changes</em></strong> in the bill by notification in the Gazette ( a written record of bills which passed as an Act). Basically, bureaucrats will have a free reign over what this bill will do after it is passed by Parliament.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And this is very serious.</p>

<p><b><strong>K) What is the role of ministers in this?</strong></b></p>
<p><strong>Arun Jaitley</strong> admits that he is forcing people to create Aadhar card and to link with Gov schemes (even though it does not follow Supreme Court’s order). –</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD) said the Supreme Court had said in September last year that Aadhaar is not mandatory and wanted to know whether the government was “<strong>forcing</strong>” people to get it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“<b><strong>Yes, we are</strong></b>,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jaitley replied.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/yqmxejgaeg-1490259699.jpeg" width="609" height="274" /></p>
<p>Mr. Narendra Modi as a<strong> CM of Gujrat</strong> thoughts that Aadhar there is no vision in this scheme-</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Aadhaar, neither the Team that I met nor PM could answer my Qs on security threat it can pose. There is no vision, only political gimmick</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 8, 2014</p>
<p><b><strong>L) So who is really responsible for this? UPA or NDA government?</strong></b></p>
<p>1.The Aadhar card or  National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 (NIDAI)  was introduced by the then PM Dr. Manmohan Singh along with Nandan Nilekani as an optional card that wasn’t meant to be mandatory for all citizens. What started out as a simple identity card that would be provided to all Indians.</p>
<p>2.The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016 is a money bill of the Parliament of India. It aims to provide legal backing to the Aadhaar unique identification number project by making it mandatory for people who want benefits subsidies or schemes.</p>
<p>3.The foundational shift that occurred between the National Identification Authority of India Bill 2010 (NIDAI) and the Aadhaar Act 2016 is clear from their respective definitions of authentication:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>NIDAI 2010</strong>: “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive or negative response or with any other appropriate response excluding any demographic information and biometric information.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aadhaar Act 2016</strong>: “The Authority shall respond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or any other appropriate response sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric information.” (emphasis added)</p>
<p><b><strong>M) Conclusion-</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar&#8217;s purpose was drastically changed. It was supposed to be beneficial for the low-income group by providing subsidies to needy people and remove leakages in the system. The current version of it, which includes mandatory linking to companies and schemes, is <strong>illegal</strong> &amp; risky. The Finance Minister&#8217;s replies to the opposition are super vague and show carelessness while introducing such important act. The disadvantages of this act are contradicting to the aim of Aadhar Act 2016. The government must fix this issue before any major harm happens ( I think all possible negative effects have already happened.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>N)Fun facts-</strong></b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Aadhar is not mandatory for <em>VIPs</em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your Jio card registered and activated within 5 minutes because of your biometric data that you provided (in this case it was your fingerprint). At the same time, you handover your <strong>demographic</strong> as well as <strong>biometric</strong> to the Jio company. And this can be misuse (perhaps found to be misused  (9) )</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making Aadhar mandatory is <em><strong>illegal</strong></em>. (I have shown you all evidence about it.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In one rare case of mixed-up identities, 2 men end up with same Aadhaar number. You know, UID means- Unique…(10)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In future Government can ask for <em>DNA</em> of citizen as a biometric data.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not <em>joking</em>. This is what FM Arun Jaitley said –</p>
<blockquote><p>Shri Satpathi wants to know whether DNA can be part of it (Aadhar).The act does not say so. Regulation can expand it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Republic TV, the self appointed high decibel self righteous custodian of patriotism is blatantly lying every single night?</p>
<p>Republic&#8217;s prime time &#8220;debate&#8221;(!) starring Arnab Goswami, prominently features a twitter hashtag along with a live count of the number of tweets. Republic promotes upcoming hashtags from as early as 3 PM onwards. Obviously, their aim is to get as many tweets with the hashtag as possible and make it trend.</p>
<h4>The Lies</h4>
<p>The number of tweets displayed on screen during the debate is a blatant lie!<br />
<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/philips-7-w-b22-led-bulb/p/itme2eggvxbzzxfu?pid=BLBE2EGGHSKCQ2FQ&amp;affid=jaykapoor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br />

<p>Here are some examples that illustrate the fake claims by Republic. In each case a screenshot showing the hashtag, count of tweets &amp; timestamp and an extract of all tweets for the hashtag are presented as proof.</p>
<h5>Example 1 &#8211; #CongChaiwalaAttack</h5>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To tax or not to tax are the eternal questions before any government and to-pay-or-not-pay is the eternal difficult choice before the people.</p>
<p>Historically taxation has been the cause of much strain between governments and its citizens. It also is one of the main causes of black money and corruption.</p>
<p>What is the solution? Can low taxes solve this problem? But, how will the Government raise revenue for its expenses?</p>
<p>Let us look at some examples of what happens when Governments lower taxes. We will start very near before we go very far.</p>
<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><br />

</script></p>
<p>Delhi’s AAP Government&#8217;s experiment in lowering taxes is a recent example closest to home. They became the lowest tax regime in the country when they slashed VAT ( before GST) from 12.5% to 5% in its 2016 budget on many consumer goods like Sweets, savories, snacks, sanitary napkins, shoes, Ready made garments, e-rickshaws marble, kota, dholpur stone, granite, MDF boards &amp; particle boards, laminates, plywood, blackboard and gave subsidies for battery operated cars. This was a bold decision because 65% of the State&#8217;s revenue comes from VAT.</p>
<p>The logic was that compliance will go up and lower taxes will encourage production and consumption.</p>
<p>Instead of revenues falling, the Govt collected 21% higher revenue as compared to previous year. Which is a lot, if you consider that the previous year they registered a growth of 13% and when VAT was higher.</p>
<p>Delhi also became a state with highest GDP in the country in spite of demonetisation which saw a dip in GDP by 2% in the entire country. Furthermore, if low taxes are clubbed with plugging of leakages in revenue then it is a win-win situation for all. For example, the Delhi Jal Board registered increase in revenue in spite giving 20,000 litres/month free water to those who had metered connections. This gave a spurt to people requesting for metered supply and the estimated enormous Rs. 20,000 crore worth of water leakage was plugged. New pipe lines in 263 colonies were laid ( something that had not been done in last 10 years) and revenue through water went up in spite of the free water.</p>
<p>Now let us move from the near to the far. Dr. Ronald D. Rotunda, distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence, <a href="https://verdict.justia.com/2014/06/23/increasing-revenue-lowering-taxes.">writes in an article</a> defending low taxation, “It is said that tax has two purposes: to raise revenue for the Government and to reduce activity of the people. For eg, alchohol, tobacco etc is taxed high not so much to increase revenue but to discourage activity that is taxed, to change behaviour.”</p>

<p>He argues that lower tax rates can produce more revenue than higher rates just as cheaper Wal-Mart makes more money than Tiffany &amp; Co. When USA lowers the capital gains rate, it collects more than when it raises it, he writes.</p>
<p>So also, high taxes makes people go in for secure investment rather than investing in business which carries risk factors or they simply take their monies to safer heavens resulting in cat-and-mouse chase between people and Governments across the globe as the recent Paradise Paper or earlier more such exposes reveal.</p>
<p>Daniel Mitchell, former McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy writes, “ There is a distinct pattern throughout American history: When tax rates are reduced, the economy’s growth rate improves and living standards increase. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/node/18247/print-display.">Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue</a></p>
<p>Therefore, when there was a successful experiment of the Delhi Govt right under their nose, one wonders why the Prime Minister and Finance minister opted for turning India into the highest paying GST in the world, especially since the nation is reeling under demonetisation and fallen GDP.</p>
<p>Lower lax rates will lift sagging sentiments, spurt investments and maybe prove that Indians are not inherently dishonest, as the Delhi AAP experiment has proved.</p>

<p>NASA&#8217;s Voyager took this picture of earth from a distance of 4 billion miles, famously known as &#8216;Pale Blue Dot&#8217;. I insist you, read this amazing <a href="http://www.awakin.org/read/view.php?tid=682">speech </a>by Astronomer Carl Sagan on it. It shows how Earth is just a pixel in this universe. Look at the above picture and you will realize how minute we are. The universe doesn&#8217;t even care about our existence. And though our actions and existence are insignificant from the Universe&#8217;s point of view, they have their own significance in the context of this &#8216;Pale Blue Dot&#8217;. Being the most intelligent species on earth it is our duty to take care of this planet and to create a sustainable and humane world. A world which is driven by logic and rationale. We, instead, embraced a world full of ideologies.</p>
<p>Leave the world aside, we have different ideologies in our country. Ideologies are driving our society. Do we even realize the impact of these ideologies? for example, in every newsroom debate, we witness panelists blaming and taming each other’s ideology. Most of them don’t have logic to support their claim. They just refer texts which were written a long time ago or the words of their ancestors. We failed to realize that these teachings come from humans like us. Our ancestors might have been wrong and even if they were right, there is a great chance that their principles/teachings might be irrelevant in present situation. Same goes with ancient texts, they were written by humans and might be irrelevant in the present scenario. So, why not apply logic instead of ideologies?</p>
<p>I believe ideologies are the reason for our conflicts. A person possessed by certain ideology can go to any extent to defend his ideology irrespective of the logical explanation. They already have an answer, they are just creating a proper explanation to support their answer. American president Bill Clinton, during an interview, shared his thoughts on ideology <em><strong>&#8220;The problem with an ideology is that it gives the answer before you look at the evidence. So you have to mold the evidence to get the answer that you have already decided”</strong></em>. We just want to defend our beliefs and ideological principles. Ideology suppress our free thinking, it won’t allow us to think rationally. Our scope of thinking is narrowed down by ideologies. Those who are possessed by ideologies don’t have a conscience left to question themselves.</p>

</script></p>
<p>There might be a community or a group or a political party whose ideology suits the current situation but there is a huge possibility that their ideology will be outdated in near future. When such time comes you don’t have the free will or courage to question that ideology because those ideologies brainwashed you. Ideologies are static while logic is dynamic. Our logic is based on current situation while Ideologies are fixed set of rules.</p>
<div>Just Like ideology, our constitution is consist of a set of rules and principles. But our constitution is continuously updating with time and changing society. So, why do we stuck with those static ideologies don’t you think that our ideologies should be updated? Well, updated ideology is also logical. When I say ideologies, I mean static set of rules, don&#8217;t get confused with the word.</div>
<div></div>
<div> It is difficult for us to question our own ideology which was taught to us since our childhood. Our ideologies were decided even before our birth. We feel uncomfortable or offended if someone questions it. In this race of ideologies we have lost our humanity, let&#8217;s leave those ideologies and claim our humanity again.I personally believe that without ideology, the world will be a better place or at least when we prioritize logic instead of ideology in our thought process and decision making.It&#8217;s time we realize that this &#8216;Pale Blue Dot&#8217; is suffering because of our arrogance.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the night of 8th November, all 500, 1000 notes were demonetised. This Demonetization shook the nation overnight. Our Prime Minister said all black money kept in cash would become useless, black money hoarders would now have to burn away their stashes or throw them in the river. Like any other common Indian, I thought this might be a great idea and congratulated Modi for it. But it took just a day of research to realise how many loopholes had been left in this scheme. on 12th November, I made this video exposing the intentional loopholes left in the scheme for corrupt people to get away with.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpQBghg_neY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

</script></p>
<p>Over time it became clear how these loopholes are going to be utilised by every single person having black money. Some started black marketing of buying demonetized currency while others used these loopholes to deposit other&#8217;s people&#8217;s black money in banks. This was proved later this year how almost all demonitized currency had returned to the banks, specifically 99%. What also became clear over time was the negative consequences, disastrous negative consequences this scheme would be having on India&#8217;s economy. Many well known economists and politicians pointed this out. Manmohan Singh and Arvind Kejriwal were among the first ones to speak against this. MMS predicted a fall of 2% of India&#8217;s GDP and called it <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Demonetisation-is-an-organised-loot-Manmohan-Singh/article16693025.ece" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organised loot</a>. AK called it India&#8217;s biggest scam ever as he believed it was meant to write off lakhs of crores of loans of billionares. They both were criticised like hell for it initially, but as time passed by, people realised how true they were. On the other hand, the BJP and PM Modi kept chest thumping on their apparent fight against Corruption through demonetization. They even went on exaggerating it&#8217;s potential benefits, from stopping terrorist attacks to becoming cashless. It was around a couple of months that DeMo became a joke that it was a solution to all problems. Anyone opposing it was labelled as anti national and reminded about Siachen ke jawan. That&#8217;s when i had released a video faking about how Demonetization stopped global warming.</p>
<div class="ast-oembed-container"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gtzg10ge4Po?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<script>

</script></p>
<p>Over the months, all potential positive benefits turned out to be sham. Neither the corruption reduced, nor the fake currency stopped printing. Cashless usage reduced to pre-demonetization era after February 2017. As for the Black money, RBI stopped giving out details fearing public backlash for months. Indian army faced one of the worst terrorst attacks in the same month as demonetisation, and later one of the worst month for casualties in April 2017. GDP loss began to reflect in the numbers, job losses happened in millions, businesses were closed down, more than 150 people even died during this whole event. All through, govts goalposts kept shifting. It was in August this year that they finally revealed the data and Demonetisation was proved to be a disaster.</p>

<p>I participated in a TV debate on Mirror Now news channel on this topic and then exposed all their nonsense excuses to make Demonetization look like a success later in this video.</p>

<p>Estimates of total loss of money to the country range from 4 Lakh Crore to 8 Lakh Crore. Regardless of the actual figure, its no doubt that Demonetization is much bigger than any existing scam done in India till now. Ironically enough, the BJP has said that they will do another one of their &#8216;grand celebration&#8217; on the one year anniversary of Demonetization, which they have called as &#8216;anti-black money&#8217; day. The day black money was converted to white.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">In a lot of my conversations with friends, I find not only a great deal of recognition of India’s problems, but also the desire to solve them. From swaraj to hunger to social strife to infrastructure to agriculture, different conversations centre around different problems, depending on the passions of the person I’m talking to. But interestingly, a very large number of these conversations finally arrive at, and get stuck at, an important piece of the puzzle — the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">lack of political will </strong>to solve India’s problems, despite citizens voicing a strong need for solutions to their problems. I find a lot of them questioning whether democracy is really the right system for India.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">What is democracy?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The idea behind democracy is something like this. Citizens have various needs and aspirations, the pursuit of which requires solving certain problems in their society/ economy. To solve these problems, they elect fellow-citizens with the ability and the willingness to represent them (legislature). These representatives, in turn, enact laws that are in sync with the aspirations and needs of the citizens, helping to solve the citizen&#8217;s problems. In short, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">democracy is a bridge between people’s needs &amp; aspirations and the government’s policies. </strong>Democracy’s job is to ensure alignment of the latter to the former.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Good politics comes from listening</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is the main purpose of democracy — that policy-making is closely guided by the needs of citizens. Monarchies and dictatorships have no such bridge between citizens’ needs and govt policies. Any “good” decision made by a dictator is purely based on guesswork as to the citizen’s needs, and not due to representation of the citizen in the policy-making process. This representation makes it compulsory for the govt to listen to the citizen’s voice. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">In a democracy, the policy-maker’s main job is to listen to the citizen. Good or bad decisions are merely a consequence </strong>of listening to the citizen. This is what Swaraj means — self-rule of citizens comes from representation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">India needs Swaraj — a more “representative” democracy</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">India’s political system has, for decades now, stopped listening to citizens about their needs and aspirations. The grassroots engagement of citizens with their representatives is totally broken. Most <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">citizens have no access to their local MLA/ MP</strong>, and do not get a chance to meet their representative even once during a 5-year term. Many are not even aware of who their representative is. The citizen’s problems, and more importantly the priority order of those problems, cannot be communicated to lawmakers. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Poor decisions that are disconnected from citizens’ real needs are a natural outcome of such a process</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Things are changing</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The good news: While India needs more representative democracy, certain parties are willing to step forward and provide it. It is important that citizens support such parties. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Citizens must demand certain mandatory minimum levels of interaction with MLAs/ MPs </strong>(e.g. at least a one-hour interaction), at a certain minimum frequency (e.g. at least once a week/ month). Such rules not only ensure better communication and representation (which is the politician’s only job), but they also ensure accountability of politicians to citizens. Such grassroots engagement gives citizens a chance to demand adherence to election manifestos and other promises made. In certain parts of India, newer and younger parties are already highly successful with their attempts at representative democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Ball in citizens’ court</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Citizens judge politicians wrongly. Our ways of judging politicians and political parties involve judging a single personality/ image/ manner of talking, or certain marquee projects/ decisions undertaken by them, without regard to whether those decisions truly reflect the aspirations and needs of citizens.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">We need to judge politicians by how well they do their only job, which is an adherence to representative democracy. It is for a reason that the act governing political parties in India is called the “Representation of People” Act. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Citizens must show their seriousness about representative democracy by voting for parties that voluntarily come up with citizen-engagement rules by themselves, </strong>and show a clear commitment to listening to citizens.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If representative democracy/ <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Swaraj helps a party win elections, then it will catch on quickly among the other parties too</strong>. After all, no party wants to lose elections. And if the rules come from parties themselves in a market-determined manner, the change will be competitive and sustainable, unlike rules that are enforced by the Election Commission or some other external body.</p>

</script></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">So when we have conversations about solutions to India’s problems, let us not judge politicians merely by their words or their image or their stated stance on issues. A politician’s main job is to represent his people, which means engaging with them and listening to them. Let us judge them by their track record of doing that. A natural result of this will be policies that are in sync with the citizen’s needs and aspirations. Good governance and development will happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This title is no exaggeration. Forget multiple crackers , Just one firecracker, one phooljhadi generates as much smoke as 74 cigarettes if you stand within one feet from it. This has been concluded by a 2016  <a href="http://www.ers-education.org/home/browse-all-content.aspx?idParent=155716">study</a> by Chest Research Foundation in Pune. It analyzed six different crackers– the snake , a 1000 cracker ladi,  phuljhadi,  pul-pul , anar  and chakri for their PM 2.5 pollution levels. These pollution levels were then compared to average PM 2.5 generated by a cigarette by <a href="http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/smoke-from-firecracker-snake-464-cigarettes-and-other-diwali-stories-53583">India Spend</a>. It then gave the following estimations of smoke generated by firecrackers compared to cigarettes &#8211;</p>

<p>1. One Chakri generates as much smoke as 68 cigarettes</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-417 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers.jpeg" alt="crackers" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers.jpeg 400w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Diwali-Chakri-Crackers-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></p>
<p>2. This seemingly harmless cracker is one of the most dangerous ones. One Snake cracker generates as much smoke as 464 cigarettes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-418 " src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks.jpg" alt="crackers" width="590" height="311" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks.jpg 759w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/black-snakes-fireworks-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>

<script>

</script></p>
<p>3. One anar cracker generates as much smoke as 34 cigarettes. This is comparatively lower than other crackers because one stands around 3 feet away from anar when it is bursting instead of the usual one feet.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-419 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar.jpg" alt="crackers" width="725" height="408" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar.jpg 1920w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Anar-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. One ladi cracker of 1000 generates as much smoke as 277 cigarettes. Even when standing further away, a ladi is one of the most polluting crackers.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-420 aligncenter" src="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="crackers" width="715" height="402" srcset="https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault.jpg 1920w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dhruvrathee.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S0 assuming on average if a cracker emits smoke as much as 100 cigarettes and you burst just 20 crackers this Diwali then you will end up inhaling as much smoke as 2000 cigarettes. With regards to pollution levels, <span style="background-color: #f6d5d9;">India </span>has a 24-hour mean standard of 60 µg/m³ for PM 2.5 pollution, while the WHO has a lower standard of 25 µg/m³. When bursting crackers, this pollution level is broken massively, where a single cracker during it&#8217;s duration of bursting is generating upto 60,000  µg/m³ of PM 2.5 pollution. Now whether you agree with <a href="https://dhruvx.wpengine.com/firecrackers-ban-good-bad/">Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to ban firecrackers</a> or not, that is a talk for some other time..</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re someone who thinks that bursting crackers is not a big source of pollution and like to blame it on other things, then think again! In no other event across the year, are your lungs this vulnerable to pollution. Overall air pollution may be caused by a variety of things from burning fields to cars or industries. But none of these other factors are ever affecting you directly by being in close proximity to you. This one day of Diwali will have an unprecedented toll on your health, should you choose to burst crackers. Fortunately enough, your health is in your own control. These distastrous health effects are only caused when you are in close proximity to crackers, that means you are bursting them yourself. So, do your lungs a favour this diwali, by staying away from crackers and advise the same to your family and friends. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
